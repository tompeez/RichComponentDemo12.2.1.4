<h3>1.1. Does ADF Faces depend on any particular implementation of JSF?<a name="a1.1._Does_ADF_Faces_depend_on_any_particular_implementation_of_JSF"></a></h3>


<p>
No. If there is an Oracle-specific implementation
of JSF, ADF Faces will be optimized to run best on that implementation,
but we believe it is important that ADF Faces run on any implementation
of the JSF 1.2 specification (or later).  ADF Faces cannot be used with
a JSF 1.1 implementation.

<p>
Please see the platform section on the <a href="installation.html#Platform_Information">installation</a> page for information on how to deploy to JDeveloper and Tomcat.
</p>

<p>
Although ADF Faces is &quot;vanilla&quot; JSF we have not been able to run with Java Studio Creator Build 04.06.2. We are working with Sun to resolve the issues in Java Studio Creator.
</p>

<p>We have done some limited testing on IBM WebSphere Studio Application Developer 5.1.2. We have been able to run using .jsp, but not .jspx. If you are running the demo WAR please make sure the file names in faces-config.xml reflect any updated file names.

<h3>1.3. Where is the source for the demos?<a name="a1.3._Where_is_the_source_for_the_demos"></a></h3>

<p>
To see the source for the ADF-Faces demos, do the following:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>Download the file adf-richclient-demo.war (see the Releases &gt; Download page of the doc for instructions on how to access the WAR file)</li> 

<li>Start up JDeveloper</li>

<li>Create a new application in JDev (File &gt; New &gt; Generic Application) </li>

<li>Right click on that application and select New &gt; Project &gt; Project from WAR file</li>

<li>Name the project appropriately (e.g. adf-richclient-demos) and click on Next... </li>

<li>Browse for the WAR file you downloaded earlier</li>

<li>Click finish</li>

<li>Run index.jspx</li>
</ol>

<p>There you go. You can now look at, tweak, and run the demos to your hearts content.</p>

<h3>2.1. Can I use standard Faces tags with ADF Faces?<a name="a2.1._Can_I_use_standard_Faces_tags_with_ADF_Faces"></a></h3>


<p>
Yes; all standard Faces tags can be used with ADF Faces.  You can even use &lt;h:form&gt; instead of &lt;af:form&gt; without losing any ADF Faces functionality.

<h3>2.4. What is the relationship between ADF Faces and ADF UIX?<a name="a2.4._What_is_the_relationship_between_ADF_Faces_and_ADF_UIX"></a></h3>


<p>
ADF Faces is a significant evolution of the ADF UIX code.  The
proprietary API (<tt>UINode</tt>, <tt>RenderingContext</tt>, etc.)
of ADF UIX has been replaced with the standard JSF API, and we've added
many features to our components that take advantage of the JSF architecture.
In making this change, we've also overhauled nearly all our component
names and  attribute names to fit in closely with JSF naming conventions.
ADF UIX and ADF Faces can be installed in a single web application
without conflicts.

<li>
           The JDeveloper Help draft for &quot;Organizing Content on Web Pages&quot; in an ADF Faces Page
           Layout is not currently accurate.  Please refer to the following information instead:
        </li>
      </ul>
      
<div><b>Symptom</b></div>
      
<ul>
<li>
        I have a component that is supposed to stretch to fit inside of another component.
        It works fine in one browser but when I run the same page in another browser, the
        component either doesn't show up or is cut off.  If I replace the component with
        something else, it works fine.  What is wrong?
      </li></ul>
      
<div><b>Solution</b></div>
      
<ul>
<li>
        The above problem is likely due to one or more of the following problems. Verify
        that each of the following guidelines are met:
        
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          
<li>
            
<div><b>The &quot;position&quot; Style</b></div>
            
<ul>
            
<li>Somewhere on the page, likely near the component that isn't displayed properly,
               is an inlineStyle that contains a &quot;position&quot; setting.  We strongly discourage
               setting this style because of how web browsers treat it.  If the style is needed,
               the component renderers will add it for you under the covers.  If you feel that
               you do need to specify it, you are not using the component in a manner that was
               intended and your page will likely behave differently in different web browsers.
               If you are concerned about &quot;position&quot; on your outer-most layout panel component,
               you may want to assign &quot;maximized&quot; to true (the default) on the document component
               and make sure that your outer-most &quot;visual root&quot; component supports stretching.
               If it does, then it will automatically be stretched to fit within the browser
               viewport.</li></ul></li>
          
<li>
            
<div><b>Percentage-Based Heights</b></div>
            
<ul>
            
<li>Somewhere on the page, likely near the component that isn't displayed
                properly, is an inlineStyle that contains a &quot;height&quot; setting with &quot;%&quot; units.
                We strongly discourage setting this kind of height because of how web browsers
                treat it. ADF Faces contains several components that support stretching of
                their children like panelSplitter and panelStretchLayout.  If your component
                is capable of being stretched, simply placing it in one of these component
                will stretch it. Some components provide optional stretching of their children
                through a &quot;childStretching&quot; attribute. If the child cannot be stretched (refer
                to the &quot;geometry management&quot; section of the component's tag documentation to
                see if that component supports being stretched), then you must wrap the child
                component inside of a transition component (one that can be stretched but does
                not stretch its children) such as panelGroupLayout where layout=&quot;scroll&quot; or
                layout=&quot;vertical&quot;. If you do not follow this guideline, your child component
                will not reliably stretch or consistently display in all of the supported
                browsers. At the time of writing, there are no places in which a percentage
                height is required.</li></ul></li>
          
<li>
            
<div><b>Invalid Component Hierarchy</b></div>
            
<ul>
            
<li>Many components cannot be reliably stretched.  This is a limitation imposed by
               the browser.  Some of the container components that cannot be stretched include
               the following:
            
<ul>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelBorderLayout&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelBox&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelFormLayout&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;default&quot;&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelHeader&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelLabelAndMessage&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;af:panelList&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;trh:tableLayout&gt;</li>
              
<li>&lt;h:panelGrid&gt;</li>
              
<li>Also, most input components cannot be stretched.</li>
            </ul>
            
<div>
              You cannot place these inside of a parent that stretches their children.  Doing so
              will cause your page to not display reliably across web browsers and will likely not
              exhibit a usable layout.  Instead if you really need the parent component, you must
              wrap the child component inside of a transition component (one that can be stretched
              but does not stretch its children) such as panelGroupLayout where layout=&quot;scroll&quot; or
              layout=&quot;vertical&quot;.
            </div></li>
            
<li>
              We recommend that your page be assembled such that you are building up a frame of
              panelStretchLayout, decorativeBox and panelSplitter components and then once
              you have all of your layout areas defined by these components, then create islands of
              non-stretching components where each island is rooted by a transition component
              as noted above.
            </li></ul></li>
        </ol></li></ul>
      
<div><b>Further Help</b></div>
      
<ul>
        
<li>Read the details in each component's &quot;Geometry Management&quot; section from its tag
            documentation.</li>
        
<li>If you don't want a stretch-to-fit layout, stop using components that stretch
            their children.  If you want no stretching at all on your page, change
            &lt;af:document&gt;'s maximized attribute to &quot;false&quot;.</li>

You cannot directly point to a JSF JSP file; you either need to add &quot;/faces&quot; after the servlet context path, or change the suffix (in the URL only) to &quot;.faces&quot;.

<p>
JSF requires the &lt;f:view&gt; JSP tag around all JSF JSP tags; this obscure error is the result of failing to include &lt;f:view&gt;.

<p>
You may have trouble seeing dialogs if you have popup blockers installed.  (Note
that this only applies to dialog framework dialogs - not to the ADF Fusion af:popup and af:dialog components).

<p>
You need to enable J2SE 1.4 Assertions. In jdev this can be done in project properties (Select Tools -&gt; Project Properties -&gt; Profiles -&gt; Development -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Enable J2SE 1.4 Assertions.)

<p>
You may be missing the &quot;setXyz()&quot; function matching the
&quot;getXyz()&quot; function that is controlling your field's value, or
you might have mispelled its name.  This makes that property
read-only.  When ADF Faces detects that an input
field is using a read-only model property, it automatically
switches the field to read-only mode, which is why it looks
like plain text.  For what it's worth, if you tried the same model
property with &lt;h:inputText&gt;, it'd look fine when you first render
the page, but JSF would throw an exception when you posted back
to the server and it couldn't write the new value into the model.

<h3>3.8 The HTML of my JSF pages is not very readable<a name="a3.8_The_HTML_of_my_JSF_pages_is_not_very_readable"></a></h3>

<p>
Adding &lt;debug-output&gt;true&lt;/debug-output&gt; to your trinidad-config.xml works (just like on 10.1.3 and now 
apache trinidad) to get your HTML of the JSF pages to be more readable.  Setting this flag will add comments showing which component 
caused which HTML to be rendered.

<p>
This is caused by having old, pre-JSF 1.1 libraries still on your classpath when the JSPs are compiled.  Follow the steps listed in the previous section, then clean and rebuild your web project.  (It may be necessary to restart JDev before cleaning and rebuilding for the JSP translator to reset itself.)

<h3>4.1. What is the difference between partialTriggers and addPartialTarget()?  When do I use one or the other?<a name="a4.1._What_is_the_difference_between_partialTriggers_and_addPartialTarget__When_do_I_use_one_or_the_other"></a></h3>

<p>
&quot;partialTriggers&quot; defines a way to define in your page what needs to get
rerendered without writing any code.  Calling addPartialTarget() requires
code.  Usually, that makes &quot;partialTriggers&quot; the better choice.  However,
if you need complex logic to decide when to rerender, or if you need
to rerender in response to something other than an event being fired
on another component, then you'll need to use addPartialTarget().  In
addition, &quot;partialTriggers&quot; will fire no matter what event happend
on the source component.  For example, a table supports multiple events -
sorting and selecting.  If you only need to rerender a component when the
selection changes, it's less efficient to use &quot;partialTriggers&quot; and
more efficient to use a selection listener.  This usually isn't a big
deal, but if the component you're rerendering is especially expensive
(a table showing results of an expensive query), keep this in mind.
</p>

<p>
One important difference to know:  when you use &quot;partialTriggers&quot;, you
have to set the ID on the component that is firing the event.  That's not
necessary when you use addPartialTarget().  But instead, you
<b>must</b> explicitly set the ID on the component that
you're rerendering.  (Setting &quot;partialTriggers&quot; acts as a hint to
a component that it needs to be ready to be PPR'd - but if you're
explicitly calling addPartialTarget() from code, we don't have that
hint.)

<h3>4.2. When I toggle &quot;rendered&quot;, PPR doesn't work.  Why?<a name="a4.2._When_I_toggle_rendered_PPR_doesnt_work.__Why"></a></h3>

<p>
PPR can change content in a page by reference to a piece of the HTML's DOM 
and an &quot;id&quot; in that HTML.  When you set rendered to false, there is no DOM
at all rendered for that component - so no way to find the &quot;id&quot; and the
location to insert the new content when you set rendered back to &quot;true&quot;.  To
work around this limitation, instead of updating the component itself,
update the parent.
