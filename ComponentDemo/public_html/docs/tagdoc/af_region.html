The region tag allows dynamic content to be included in a master page.
This tag is bound to a RegionModel. The model decides which viewId is to
be included. The model has methods that allow pre and post processing of
an include. See the javadoc for
oracle.adf.view.rich.model.RegionModel.
This component does not support any facets.
Regions support nesting (one af:region component can contain another af:region component).  Regions are not allowed to be placed inside of af:forEach, c:forEach, or other forEach-like tags because of limitations in how JSF handles component IDs and component state which would manifest in your application in obscure manners such as loss of component state.  Regions are also not allowed to be placed inside of af:iterator because the region requires bindings to be established at the tag execution phase in order to perform its JSP include operations and the variables for iterators are not established until later in the life-cycle.

<p></p>
Regions in release 11g are reusable page flows.  They have their own
navigation rules, managed beans and ADFm page definitions.  Each page within
the region is a page fragment (jsff). Do not confuse the 11g af:region
component with the 10.1.3 or Trinidad region.  The 10.1.3 and Trinidad region
components are single page fragments that do not have multiple pages,
navigation rules nor managed beans.  The 10.1.3 region is similar to the 11g
page templates and declarative components.

<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children only if the region header is not present.  If the header is present and you put the region in a location that will stretch it or if you define styles to attempt to stretch it, you will see unpredictable results across web browsers.  Instead, you may need to wrap the region in a transition component such as &lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt; to prevent automatic stretching.</li>

<li>This component gets children dynamically depending on what view is included from its RegionModel.  The &lt;af:region&gt; will not stretch all included children, but it will stretch an included child if all of the following are true:

<ul>

<li>The region itself does not have a header</li>

<li>The region itself is being stretched</li>

<li>There is only a single included child</li>

<li>The child must be capable of being stretched</li>
</ul>
Examples of components that can be stretched inside of a &lt;af:region&gt; include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:decorativeBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelAccordion&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelBox type=&quot;stretch&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelCollection&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelHeader type=&quot;stretch&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelSplitter&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelStretchLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelTabbed&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:region&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:table&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:tree&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:treeTable&gt;</li>
</ul>
If the region itself is being stretched and the included child cannot be stretched, you will then need to wrap it in another layout component that does not stretch its children.  For example, a common wrapper is the &lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;.  By using a wrapper like this, you create a flowing layout area where nothing will be stretched inside of it.  Examples of components that cannot be stretched inside of a &lt;af:region&gt; include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:panelBorderLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelBox type=&quot;flow&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelFormLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;default&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelHeader type=&quot;flow&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelLabelAndMessage&gt;</li>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>
