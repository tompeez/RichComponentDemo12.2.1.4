The decorativeBox component can be used to apply a bordered look to its children (i.e. rounded
corners). It also supports changing of the rendered theme of its children, so can act as a
look and feel transition between areas on a page.  For example, a page that has a dark
background for its template can use the decorative box to transition to a white background for
its main area.

This component stretches the child component in the center facet to fill all of available space.
It is bordered by eight styled areas that are controlled using skinning keys. The areas
listed below are documented in the skinning documentation:


<ul>
  
<li>top-start</li>
  
<li>top</li>
  
<li>top-end</li>
  
<li>start</li>
  
<li>end</li>
  
<li>bottom-start</li>
  
<li>bottom</li>
  
<li>bottom-end</li>
</ul>

The height of the top area of the component depends on whether or not a component has
been put into the top facet.  When the facet is set, the
topHeight attribute is used to specify the size the content should
occupy.  Without a component in the top facet, the -tr-height skin property will be used
to determine the height. See the skinning keys documentation for more information on the
available skinning keys and properties for the decorative box component.


<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>
  
<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its
  children, e.g. panelStretchLayout if the dimensionsFrom attribute of this decorativeBox is set to &quot;parent&quot;.</li>
  
<li>This component uses &lt;f:facet name=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
    and &lt;f:facet name=&quot;center&quot;&gt; to organize
    content into each box.  Examples of child components that can be stretched
    inside of these facets include:
    
<ul>
      
<li>&lt;af:decorativeBox&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelAccordion&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelBox&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelCollection&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelHeader&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelSplitter&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelStretchLayout&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelTabbed&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:region&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:table&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:tree&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:treeTable&gt;</li>
    </ul>

If you try to put a component inside of this component and that child component does not support being stretched, then the component hierarchy is illegal.
To make it legal, you need to insert another intermediate component between this component and the child component.
This intermediate component must support being stretched and must not stretch its children.
An example of such a component that is commonly used for this purpose is &lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;.
By using a wrapper like this, you create a flowing layout area where nothing will be stretched inside of it.
Examples of components that do not support being stretched inside of these panelStretchLayout facets (and therefore need to be wrapped) include:

    
<ul>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelBorderLayout&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelFormLayout&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;default&quot;&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelLabelAndMessage&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;af:panelList&gt;</li>
      
<li>&lt;trh:tableLayout&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
There are other ways in which you can control the geometry of this component when it is not being stretched by its ancestor:

<ul>

<li>You can specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;children&quot; for the decorativeBox to be as tall as the children.  When using this &quot;children&quot; setting, the topHeight attribute will still be honored (unless percent units are specified) but any height assignment (e.g. inlineStyle or styleClass) on the decorativeBox must be omitted or else there would be a competing assignment for how tall the component will be.</li>

<li>You can also specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot; to make the decorativeBox get its dimensions from the inlineStyle and if not provided from there then from its parent component or if not provided from the parent then from the skin.</li>

<li>Using dimensionsFrom=&quot;auto&quot; will choose either &quot;children&quot; or &quot;parent&quot; depending on whether the decorativeBox is being stretched by its parent.</li>
</ul>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the

            usage of the shortDesc attribute.

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and
