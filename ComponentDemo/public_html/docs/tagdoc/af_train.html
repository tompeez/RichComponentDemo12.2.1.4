The train component presents a user with a series of stops, each stop representing a step 
         in a multi-step process. The train walks the user through these steps, in a suggested order
         (the order being dictated by the underlying model). Each step is rendered as a train stop 
         consisting of an image and a textual link indicating if they are in visited, current, 
         unvisited and disabled states. Train can also be rendered in a vertical layout - the 
         default being a horizontal layout. Trains are not rendered on printable pages.
        
<div class="section">
<h2>Model<a name="Model"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            The train takes a model of type <tt>org.apache.myfaces.adf.model.MenuModel</tt> that 
            in turn extends a TreeModel. The last node along the focus path and its siblings are 
            rendered as train stops.
            The default MenuModel implementation knows how to go from the current viewId to the 
            focusRowKey. Notice that the MenuModel has no special knowledge of page navigation and 
            places no requirements on the nodes that go into the tree. The last node along with its
            sibling, in the tree are stamped out using the &quot;nodeStamp&quot; facet, which should contain a 
            commandNavigationItem component. This allows the default actionListener mechanism to be 
            used for page navigation. 
          
<p></p>
            <b>Note</b>: When using Facelets as the page declaration language (PDL), the 'nodestamp' 
            facet, if explicitly specified, should contain only one commandNavigationItem. Multiple 
            components are not supported by this facet.
        
<div class="section">
<h2>Behavior<a name="Behavior"></a></h2>      
          
<p></p>
            The train behavior (how the train takes the user through its steps in a multi-step 
            process) is dictated by the model implementation. Product teams are encouraged to 
            implement custom behavior to suit their needs. The following behaviors allow the user to 
            walk through a series of steps in a sequential order, but they exhibit slightly different
            behaviors. 
            
<ul>
              
<li>&quot;Plus One&quot; - From the current stop the user can navigate to any previous visited 
              stops and the next enabled stop (in unvisited state). The remaining stops appear 
              disabled. <br />
              So, if the user is on the 5th step of a process and goes back to step 2, then the user 
              can only navigate to step 1  (which appears as a visited stop) and step 3 (appears as 
              an unvisited stop). Steps 4 and 5 cannot be reached (and the corresponding stops 
              appear disabled).
              </li>
              
<li>&quot;Max Visited&quot; - From the current stop the user can navigate to any previous stops 
              and the next enabled stop (or upto the max visited stop). If the current stop happens 
              to be the max visited stop then the next stop is enabled (and in unvisited state). The 
              remaining stops appear disabled. <br />
              So, if the user is on the 5th step of a process and goes back to step 2, then the 
              user can navigate from step 2 to steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as they all have been 
              visited (except for the current stop they all appear in visited state). Now if the 
              user in on step 5, step 6 will be enabled (and the stop appears in unvisited state).
              </li>
            </ul>
          
<p></p>
            The class <tt>org.apache.myfaces.adf.model.ProcessMenuModel</tt> 
            and <tt>org.apache.myfaces.adf.model.ProcessUtils</tt> were created to support the 
            &quot;Plus One&quot; and &quot;Max Visited&quot; scenarios. Please see the javadoc for these classes for 
            more information. 
        
<div class="section">
<h2>Sub-Process<a name="Sub-Process"></a></h2>          
          
<p></p>
            A multi-step process may be launched from within another multi-step process, or a 
            multi-step process may be nested inside another process as one of its steps. When the 
            user navigates to a step in a sub-process, the parent train is represented as an icon
            appended before and after the sub-train, to indicate that the sub-train is a 
            sub-process. 
        
<div class="section">
<h2>Simplified Train Tag Usage<a name="Simplified_Train_Tag_Usage"></a></h2>       
          
<p></p>
            The tag usage for the train component has been simplified. This tag can be used in its
            simpler form as below:
            <br />
            <tt>&lt;af:train value=&quot;#{my_bean.menuModel}&quot;/&gt;</tt>
            <br />          
            
<ul>
              
<li><b>The benefits of using the simpler tag are:</b>
                
<ul>
                  
<li>
                    Simpler and smaller jspx pages. There is no need to specify the nodestamp 
                    facet (that includes a commandNavigationItem) in every page that contains a 
                    train component.
                  </li>
                  
<li>
                    This means that the commandNavigationItem component (that is used to stamp out 
                    the train stops) is now created implicitly. Also the EL expressions are bound 
                    to the relevant properties of the component automatically.</li>
                  
<li>
                    The properties of commandNavigationItem that are EL bound automatically are - 
                    action, disabled, immediate, messageType, shortDesc, showRequired, 
                    textAndAccessKey and visited.
                  </li>
                  
<li>
                    The only requirement for using the simplified train tag is that customers need 
                    to ensure that the object that represents the model for a train stop, resemble 
                    (contain the same methods as) 
                    <tt>oracle.adf.view.rich.model.TrainStopModel</tt> . IOW, the object 
                    returned from the call to CollectionModel.getRowData(int) should be an object 
                    resembling TrainStopModel or be a subclass of TrainStopModel.
                  </li>
                  
<li>
                    NOTE: Customers can still use the full-blown tag usage, depending on their
                    specific use cases. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children, e.g. panelStretchLayout, panelSplitter.</li>

<li>This component uses overflow when there is not enough horizontal space to display all items.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h2>Overflow<a name="Overflow"></a></h2>

<p></p>Train is an overflow component. It must be part of a supported layout in order to work 
        properly on the page.

<p></p>An overflow component requires that it is either:

<ul>

<li>in a container that stretches its children, or</li>

<li>in a container that has a set width.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>Under these circumstances, when the overflow component is larger than the parent container, 
        the overflow component will display an overflow button. Selecting the overflow button will 
        show a popup containing the items that didn't fit on the page.

<p></p>Setting up an overflow component with the following layouts is not supported. If you use one 
        of these layouts, you may have unexpected and inconsistent results:

<ul>

<li>in a container that does not stretch its children.</li>

<li>in a container that displays multiple children horizontally without explicit sizes 
         for each child. For example, a panelGroupLayout with layout='horizontal' would be 
         invalid, but panelSplitter is OK because it has an explicitly set splitter position.</li>

<li>setting the overflow component with a styleClass or inlineStyle that assigns a 
         percentage width value. Note that this includes assigning 
         styleClass='AFStretchWidth' on an overflow component.</li>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is

                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that

<html>
 Name of the EL variable used to reference the varStatus information.
          Once this component has completed rendering, this variable is
          removed (or reverted back to its previous value).
          The VarStatus provides contextual information about the state of the
          component to EL expressions. For components that iterate, varStatus
          also provides loop counter information.  Please see the this 
          component's documentation for the specific properties on the varStatus.
          The common properties on varStatus include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;model&quot; - returns the CollectionModel for this component</li>
<li>&quot;index&quot; - returns the zero based row index</li></ul></html></td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
