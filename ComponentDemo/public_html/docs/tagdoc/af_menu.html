            A menu is a vertical container for menu items. A menu consists of two main parts - the 
            menu link and the menu container. The menu link is what you click on to open the menu 
            popup. The menu container is the popup that opens when you click on the menu link. The 
            menu container displays the contents of the menu, which are menu items. These items are 
            typically commandMenuItems, goMenuItems, and submenus. Menus are not rendered on 
            printable pages.
              
            
<div class="section">
<h2>Allowed Children<a name="Allowed_Children"></a></h2>
            
<p></p>
              A menu is designed to only hold menus, commandMenuItems, goMenuItems, and groups of 
              these same components. A menuBar can also dynamically add children of these allowed 
              types using a facetRef, iterator, or switcher. 
            
            
<p></p>
              Besides these components, other types of children are not allowed. This is because the 
              menu provides special menu functionality, like in menu type access key behavior and 
              arrow key support that will not function correctly if other components are included in 
              the menu.             
            
            
<div class="section">
<h2>Special Menu Functionality<a name="Special_Menu_Functionality"></a></h2>
            
<p></p>
              Menus provide special menu functionality, including menu type access key behavior, and 
              arrow key support. 
            
            
<div class="section">
<h3>Menu Type Access Key Behavior<a name="Menu_Type_Access_Key_Behavior"></a></h3>
            
<p></p>
              With menu type access key behavior, once your keyboard focus is in a menu or menuBar, 
              you can simply press the access key without modifiers to move the focus to the menu 
              item in that menu or menubar with that access key. 
            
            </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Arrow Key Support<a name="Arrow_Key_Support"></a></h3>
            
<p></p>
              Arrow keys provide convenient keyboard focus movement between items in a menu and its 
              parent menuBar. While in a menu you can press the up and down arrow keys to cycle 
              through the menu items. If your menu is rooted in a menuBar, then pressing the left or 
              right arrow keys closes the menu and moves the focus to the previous or next menu item 
              on the menBar. The exception to this is pressing the right arrow key while on a 
              submenu item, which will open that submenu instead and place focus on its first item. 
              While inside a detachable submenu, pressing ctrl plus arrow keys will cause the 
              detachable menu to become detached and move in the specified direction.
            
            </div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Grouping Items in a Menu&quot;<a name="Grouping_Items_in_a_Menu"></a></h2>
            
<p></p>
              If you use <tt>&lt;af:group&gt;</tt> to group items inside a menu, the menu will 
              include separators around the group. You should also not that the group has an effect 
              on certain items. For example, commandMenuItems  with type of radio that are grouped 
              together are automatically considered part of the same radio group.
            
            
<div class="section">
<h2>Menu Size and Scrolling<a name="Menu_Size_and_Scrolling"></a></h2>
            
<p></p>
              The number of items displayed in a menu is limited in size by the -tr-visible-items
              property. When there are more items than the display limit, scroll up and scroll
              down icons are displayedfor the menu, allowing the user to scroll through the menu 
              contents.
            
            
<div class="section">
<h2>Menu Types<a name="Menu_Types"></a></h2>
            
<p></p>
              There are several different types of menus, determined by the parent component of the 
              menu as well as the menu's attributes.
            
            
<div class="section">
<h3>Root Menu<a name="Root_Menu"></a></h3>
            
<p></p>
              Menu components that are placed inside a menuBar are called root menus. The menu item 
              links are placed horizontally across the menuBar. When the menu item link is selected, 
              the menu container opens up, displaying the menu contents.
            
            </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Submenu<a name="Submenu"></a></h3>
            
<p></p>
              Menu components that are placed inside another menu component are called submenus. The 
              submenu item links are placed vertically inside the parent menu. When the submenu item 
              link is selected, the submenu container opens. There is no enforced maximum depth to 
              the level of submenu nesting, although it is generally considered a good UI practice 
              to limit nested menus to no more than 3 levels deep.
            
            </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Detachable Submenu<a name="Detachable_Submenu"></a></h3>
            
<p></p>
              A detachable submenu is a submenu that has its detachable attribute set to true. This 
              submenu has a handle area at the top of the menu that can be used to grab the submenu 
              and drag it to a desireable spot where it will remain open.
            
            </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Menu Popup<a name="Menu_Popup"></a></h3>
            
<p></p>
              A menu component can also be placed directly inside a popup component as the single immediate child. 
              This is typically called a menu popup. In the case of a menu popup, the menu component does 
              not provide the menu item link. In otherwords, the text attribute of the menu does not 
              appear anywhere on the page. Instead, you would create another command component 
              (a component supporting action, like a link or button) that would be set to open the 
              menu popup. 
            
            </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Context Menu<a name="Context_Menu"></a></h3>
            
<p></p>
              A menu popup that is set to open on a right mouse click is typically refered to as a 
              context menu. This type of popup is defined by placing the menu as the single immediate child 
              of the af:popup.
             
          </div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>
            
<ul>
              
<li>There are two distinct parts to a menu. The menu item does not render on its 
                own, must be inside a menu or menuBar. The menu popup (an opened menu) has its own 
                fixed size and is not effected by layout.</li>

<li> Normally the text or textAndAccessKey will be used as the label for the component. </li>

<li> When there is no text (like an icon only button), the shortDesc must be defined - the shortDesc will be used as the label for the component. </li>

<li> The text or shortDesc value should indicate the action that will take place and should make sense when read out of context.  &quot;Click Here&quot; or &quot;Use this Button&quot; would not be acceptable.  &quot;Go to Index&quot;, &quot;Print Content&quot; or &quot;Submit Request&quot; are acceptable. </li>

the function of the menu must be defined, and the shortDesc is used as the alt text for the

a character used to gain quick access to this menu.
        
<p></p>
        If the same access key appears in multiple input fields in the same
        page of output, the rendering user agent will cycle among the elements
        accessed by the similar keys. Note that user agents are inconsistent
        about dealing with two links having same access key, and so the cycling
        behavior is dependent on what the user agent provides.
        
        
<p></p>
        This attribute is sometimes referred to as the &quot;mnemonic&quot;.
        
        
<p></p>
        The character specified by this attribute <b>must</b> exist
        in the <tt>Text</tt> attribute of this button instance. If it does
        not, the user will receive no visual indication of the existence of the
        accessKey. The easiest, and most convenient way to specify both the
        text and the mnemonic together is to use textAndAccessKey.
        
        
<p></p>
        Note that the accessKey is triggered by browser-specific and platform-specific 
        modifier keys. It even has browser-specific meaning. For example, Internet 
        Explorer will set focus when you press Alt+&lt;accessKey&gt;. Firefox sets focus
        on some operating systems when you press Alt+Shift+&lt;accessKey&gt;. 
        Firefox on other operating systems sets focus when you press Control+&lt;accessKey&gt;. 
        Refer to your browser's documentation for how it treats access keys.
        
        
<p></p>
        Beyond normal type menu access key behavior, menus and commandMenuItems support menu-type
        access key behavior when the focus is currently in a menu or menuBar. Menu-type access key
        behavior allows access to contained menus, submenus, and commandMenuItems without the need 
        for any keyboard modifiers. When the focus is inside a menu or menuBar, you can simply press 
        the accessKey, without modifiers, for a menu or commandMenuItem accessible within the menu 
        or menuBar to immediately move focus to that menu item.</td>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

contentDelivery is immediate, which means the menu content will be sent to the client on initial

<p></p>An attribute specifying ways to render icon.
           
<ul>
           
<li> reference - icon will be rendered as &quot;img&quot; tag. </li>

<li> fetchAndInline - svg icon will be fetched using XHR and 
               will be rendered inline as &quot;svg&quot; tag. For subsequent requests, 
               svg will be served from browser cache</li>
           
<li> auto - Lets the framework decide the optimal rendering mode. 
           You can use the skinnng property -tr-icon-delivery to override default framework behavior. 
           Skinning property -tr-icon-delivery can be set to any one of

<html>the identifier for the component.  Every component may be named by a component identifier that must conform to the following rules:

<ul>

<li>They must start with a letter (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method) or underscore ( _ ).</li>

<li>Subsequent characters must be letters (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method), digits as defined by the Character.isDigit() method, 
dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers 
be as short as possible. If a component has been given an identifier, it must be unique in the namespace of the closest ancestor to that component 
that is a NamingContainer (if any).</li>

<tr class="a">

<td>inlineStyle</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the CSS styles to use for this component. This
is intended for basic style changes. The inlineStyle is a set of CSS styles
that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>partialTriggers</td>
<td>String[]</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the IDs of the components that should trigger a partial update.
        This component will listen on the trigger components. If one of the
        trigger components receives an event that will cause it to update
        in some way, this component will request to be updated too.
        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of
        two naming containers (including itself if the component is a naming container)
        and begin the search from there, etc.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>rendered</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />whether the component is rendered. When set to false, no output will be
		delivered for this component (the component will not in any way be rendered,
		and cannot be made visible on the client). If you want to change a component's
		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the
                parent refreshes and in turn will render this component.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>shortDesc</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can
                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you
                     can use one of our public style classes, like 'AFInstructionText'.</td>

              For example, setting this attribute to &quot;T&amp;amp;ext&quot; will

<td>unsecure</td>
<td>java.util.Set</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />

      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
