<p></p>The popup component is an invisible container control whose contents will be used in popup windows, such as context 
	            menus, note windows, dialogs and popup selectors.  These types of &quot;popup windows&quot; are within the same browser window 
		    and using layers of HTML to simulate an external browser window.

	         
<p></p>The inline popup should not be confused with the dialog framework.  See the command family of components for more 
	            information on the dialog framework.

<p></p>This type of popup has rounded or square corners depending on the selected skins.</td>

<p></p>An inline selector type of popup should be aligned to another element.  If alignment properties are not specified, 
                            the default alignment will be to the top-start of the page.
			 
<p></p>When shown, this type of popup will steal focus for the primary window and set focus to the first focusable element 
			    within its content.
                         
<p></p>The inline selector type of popup will auto dismiss when focus leaves the content of the popup.  Activating the popup's 
			    launch source when the inline selector is shown will dismiss this type of popup.  When the popup is not visible, 
			    activating the launch source will cause the popup to be shown.  An inline selector will automatically dismiss when its 
			    alignment element is clipped and no longer visible in the browser window. Pressing the escape key will also cause the popup
                            to cancel.

<p></p>The inline selector is good for displaying arbitrary content.  Because of its dismissal properties, it should not be

			    on the placement of it in the browser window to prevent clipping. 
                         
<p></p>The note window popup will not steal focus when shown.  Focus will remain on the launch source.
			 
<p></p>A note window will automatically dismiss when focus is made outside of the note window's content or from the

<p></p>The dialogs components resemble a window.  They are framed with a title bar and close icon.  They have rounded corners 
		            in the rich skin and square corners in the medium and simple skins.  Both components can be displayed modal or modeless.  
			    When displayed as modal, a glass pane covers the primary window and the dialog becomes the new primary window.  The 
			    <tt>af:dialog</tt> component has a button bar footer but the <tt>af:panelWindow</tt> does not.
		     </td>
		     
<td>
<p></p>Dialogs can align to a component but generally are used with default alignment.  The default alignment of dialogs is 
			    the center of the browser window.  A dialog can be repositioned on the page using drag-and-drop.  The title bar is 
			    the gripper for the drag source.  Dialogs will be auto positioned to stay within the browser window when the browser 
			    is resized as long as the browser window is larger than the dialog.
                         
<p></p>Dialogs will not auto dismiss like other types of popups.  Dialogs will not dismiss when loosing focus.  They will 
			    not auto dismiss when cropped like other types of popups.  Dialogs can be closed using the close icon, predefined 
			    button configurations (<tt>af:dialog</tt> only) or programmability using a JavaScript fragment. 
                            Like the other types of popups, the escape key will cause the popup to be canceled.
                         
<p></p>When a dialog is opened, it will steal focus from the primary window.   The <i>ctrl+alt+w</i> key combination can 
			    be used to cycle through open dialog instances above the primary window.  A modal dialog is defined as a primary window.  
			    When a dialog loose focus, its appearance changes to an inactive state.
		     </td>
		     
<td>
<p></p>Dialogs are designed for data entry.  They do not have implicit dismissal properties like the other types of popups 
			    making them ideal additional data collection flows.

<div class="section">
<h3>Delivering the Content to the Client<a name="Delivering_the_Content_to_the_Client"></a></h3>
		 
<p></p>The popup component is a container that contains a page fragment.  The page fragment is hidden by default 
		    and requires a client action or event in order to be shown.  The popup conditionally determines when markup 
		    is sent to the client by its <tt>contentDelivery</tt> property.  The default content delivery is 
		    <tt>lazy</tt>.  This means the content of the popup is not delivered to the client until shown the 
		    first time. 
                   
	         The options are:
                 
<ul>
		   
<li>
<p></p><tt>lazy</tt> -- the default strategy described above.  The content
		     isn't loaded until you show the popup once, but then is cached.</li>
		   
<li>
<p></p><tt>immediate</tt> -- load the content onto the page immediately,
                     so it displays as rapidly as possible.  Use this for popups
		     that are certain to be used by all users every time they use this page.</li>
                   
<li>
<p></p><tt>lazyUncached</tt> -- the content isn't loaded until you show the
                     popup, and then is re-fetched every subsequent time you show the popup.
		     Use this strategy if the popup shows data that can become stale.</li>
		 </ul>

		 
<p></p>The popup's content delivery options are often misinterpreted.  The content delivery defines when the markup 
		    is delivered to the client browser.  The popup component doesn't try to intelligently manage a sub view of 
		    components like the <tt>af:region</tt> component.  It assumes the sub component tree that represents 
		    its content has already been built.

<div class="section">
<h3>Controlling Aspects of Auto-dismissal<a name="Controlling_Aspects_of_Auto-dismissal"></a></h3>
	         
<p></p>By default, an inline popup will auto-dismiss when the markup that defines it has been replaced.  This behavior 
                    is controlled by the <tt>autoCancel</tt> property.  There are several scenarios that might cause implicit 
                    auto-dismissal of inline popups.
                 
<ul>
                   
<li>Uses of full submit command components.  Full submit commands cause the entire document to be reloaded versus 
                       a partial submit command that results in partial content delivery.</li>
                   
<li>The popup component or parent of the popup component has been added as a partial target.</li>
                   
<li>The popup is contained within a component that toggles disclosed.  A <tt>af:showDetailItem</tt> in a 
                       <tt>af:panelTabbed</tt> is an example.</li>
                   
<li>An inline popup is shown and a failover occurs.  During a failover, the entire document is replaced.</li>  
                 </ul>
                 
<p></p>For these scenarios, if the <tt>autoCancel</tt> property is set to <tt>enabled</tt>, the popup in question 
                    will not restore visibility.  It will implicitly auto-dismiss.  

                 
<p></p>However, if the <tt>autoCancel</tt> property is <tt>disabled</tt>, the popup will restore visibility instead 
                 of auto-dismissing.  The popup must be explicitly dismissed by one of the expected/assumed dismissal behaviors 
                 for the type of popup or programmatically handled.  See the next section on displaying and hiding popups.
                 
		 </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Displaying/Hiding Popups<a name="DisplayingHiding_Popups"></a></h3>
		 
<p></p>The inline popup is client centric meaning that its states and behaviors are based on client events and actions.  
		    The client popup component has operations for showing and dismissing the popup.  Beside JavaScript extension points, 
		    there are declarative and assumed behaviors.
	         
<div class="section">
<h4>Declarative<a name="Declarative"></a></h4>
		 
<p></p>The best way to show a popup is with the <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag. Simply add this tag to a command 
		    component anywhere on your page, and activating that command will show a popup behavior tag.  When used to open 
		    various types of popups, inline selector, note window, menu, dialog and panelWindow, you are sure to get many of 
		    the built in - assumed behaviors for free without having to write JavaScript.  

	         
<p></p>For example, the <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag adds a delay when showing a popup using the 
		     <tt>mouseHover</tt> trigger type and added logic to track from what launch source a popup request was made 
		     to determine if the popup is shown in the correct context. Many of the 
		     auto dismissal options for the various types of popup's are dependent on using this special behavior tag.

	         
<div class="source">
<pre>
&amp;lt;af:outputText id=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;hover over this text with the mouse to launch a note window&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;af:showPopupBehavior popupId=&quot;noteWindow&quot; triggerType=&quot;mouseHover&quot; alignId=&quot;text&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/af:outputText&amp;gt;
		 </pre></div>
                 
<div class="section">
<h5>Programmatic<a name="Programmatic"></a></h5>
		 
<p></p>Popups can be opened using JavaScript although using the <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag is best-practice.  
		    In order to open a popup in script, you need to know how to use the client framework API to find the popup and 
		    invoke the show method.  The show method is passed a map of hints.  The popup hints parameters communicate 
		    various behaviors such as alignment.  Most of the hints are considered private and only a few are exposed 
		    as public.  The <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag uses the private hits exposing features not possible 
		    with the programmatic method of showing a popup.

                
<p></p>There are two classifications of popup dismissals, hide and cancel.  When a popup is closed by auto-dismissal, 
                   it is canceled.  If it is closed by an affirmative condition, it is hidden.  Both types of dismissals will 
                   result in raising a popup closed event.  Canceling a popup will raise a client popup canceled event that has 
                   an associated server-side counter part.

	    
<p></p>The popup hints that are considered public are found on the <tt>AdfRichPopup</tt> client component and are 
	       used for alignment positioning.  There are two map keys that define where a popup is shown on the page.   
	       The first key, <tt>AdfRichPopup.HINT_ALIGN_ID</tt> is used to specify the client component's id that the 
	       popup should align to.  Unlike the popupId attribute of the <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag that uses 
	       relative positioning from the associated launcher component, this must be the fully qualified client id of 
	       the popup component.   The second parameter, <tt>AdfRichPopup.HINT_ALIGN</tt> defines how the popup 
	       should align to the aligning component.  
               There are nine predefined align enumerations represented by constants:
               
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

		     corner aligned with the lower-left corner of the element. The bottom edges of the element and the popup are aligned.</li>
                  
<li>
<p></p><tt>AdfRichPopup.ALIGN_START_BEFORE</tt>: The popup appears to the left of the element with the popup's upper-right 
		     corner aligned with the upper-left corner of the element. The top edges of the element and the popup are aligned.</li>
                  
<li>
<p></p><tt>AdfRichPopup.ALIGN_START_CENTER</tt>: The popup appears to the left of the element with the popup's middle point 
         is aligned with the middle point of the element. The middle of the element and the popup are aligned.</li>
                  
<li>
<p></p><tt>AdfRichPopup.ALIGN_OVERLAP</tt>: The popup appears over top of the element with the upper-left corners aligned.</li>
               </ol>
               
      
<p></p>The popup hint, <tt>AdfRichPopup.HINT_TAIL</tt> indicates if a popup tail is shown. 
         The tail value is associated with its visual presentation defined in the active skin. Other than out of the box values, it can have any custom value. 
         But have to define styling in custom skin.  
               There are two out of the box tail options:
               
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
           
<li>
<p></p><tt>AdfRichPopup.TAIL_NONE</tt>: The popup tail will not be shown.</li>
           
<li>
<p></p><tt>AdfRichPopup.TAIL_SIMPLE</tt>: The popup tail will be shown and applies the out of the box styling.</li>
               </ol>       
               
               
<p></p>The third popup hint doesn't have to do with positioning but rather the context that the popup fetch event is invoked.  
                  The <tt>AdfRichPopup.HINT_LAUNCH_ID</tt> hint defines the component that launched the popup.  The value should be set with the 
                  clientId of the launcher component.  If the <tt>eventContext</tt> property is set to &quot;launcher&quot;, this popup hint is required 
                  in order for the popup fetch event to be fired from the context of the launcher component.

	       Following snippet of JSP and script demonstrates how to programmatically show and hide a popup:

</pre></div>

<p></p>Server-side listeners, such as action listeners, can show a popup.  This might sound inconsistent with the description 
of the inline popup framework as being client centric but similar operations exist on the server-side popup component
to show, hide and cancel a popup.  One caveat to keep in mind is that the popup must be in the proper context when 
the server-side API is called.  This is particularly important for a popup in a stamped component such as a table.  
The model must be position to the right row key in order for the client id to be properly encoded.
The following code demonstrates how to open and close a popup server-side:

<div class="source">
<pre>
...
...			  
&amp;lt;af:form&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;af:popup id=&quot;popup&quot; binding=&quot;#{testBean.popup}&quot;&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;af:panelWindow title=&quot;Test&quot;&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;af:button text=&quot;Hide&quot; partialSubmit=&quot;true&quot; actionListener=&quot;#{testBean.hidePopupActionListener}&quot;/&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;af:button text=&quot;Cancel&quot; partialSubmit=&quot;true&quot; actionListener=&quot;#{testBean.cancelPopupActionListener}&quot;/&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/af:panelWindow&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/af:popup&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;af:button text=&quot;Show&quot; partialSubmit=&quot;true&quot; actionListener=&quot;#{testBean.showPopupActionListener}&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/af:form&amp;gt;
...
...
public void showPopupActionListener(ActionEvent event) 
{
  UIComponent source = (UIComponent) event.getSource();
  // get the popup component - see binding=&quot;#{testBean.popup}&quot; in the tag source
  RichPopup popup = getPopup();
  RichPopup.PopupHints hints = new RichPopup.PopupHints();
  hints.add(RichPopup.PopupHints.HintTypes.HINT_ALIGN_ID, source)
      .add(RichPopup.PopupHints.HintTypes.HINT_LAUNCH_ID, source)
      .add(RichPopup.PopupHints.HintTypes.HINT_ALIGN, 
           RichPopup.PopupHints.AlignTypes.ALIGN_AFTER_END);
  popup.show(hints);
}
public void hidePopupActionListener(ActionEvent event) 
{
  FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
  // get the popup component - see binding=&quot;#{testBean.popup}&quot; in the tag source
  RichPopup popup = getPopup();
  popup.hide();
}
public void cancelPopupActionListener(ActionEvent event) 
{
  FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
  // get the popup component - see binding=&quot;#{testBean.popup}&quot; in the tag source
  RichPopup popup = getPopup();
  popup.cancel();
}
</pre></div>

</div></div></div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Client-only Popup Events<a name="Client-only_Popup_Events"></a></h3>

<p></p>Besides the operations, the inline popup has several client events.  Most of the client events do not have corresponding 
faces events or server-side listeners.  However, the <tt>popupCanceled</tt> event does provide a corresponding server-side event.
These events can be exploited using the clientListener tag and custom JavaScript functions.

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
 
<li>
<p></p><tt>popupOpening</tt>: A client only event that can be canceled.  If this event is canceled in a client-side 
     listener, the popup will not be shown.</li>
 
<li>
<p></p><tt>popupOpened</tt>: This event is fired after the popup becomes visible.  This event could be used to create 
     custom rules for overriding default focus within the popup.</li>
 
<li>
<p></p><tt>popupCanceled</tt>: The canceled event is fired when a popup is unexpectedly dismissed by auto-dismissal or 
     by explicitly invoking the popup client component's <tt>cancel</tt> method.</li>
 
<li>
<p></p><tt>popupClosed</tt>: The closed event is a client only event fired when the popup is hidden.</li>
</ol>


<p></p>Not all inline popup's provide server-side counter parts for all client events.  However, custom client event listeners 
   can invoke JavaScript that raises a <tt>CustomEvent</tt> that is handled by a <tt>af:serverListener</tt>.

<div class="source">
<pre>
...
...
&amp;lt;af:resource type=&quot;javascript&quot;&amp;gt;
  function popupClosedListener(event) 
  {
    var source = event.getSource();
    var popupId = source.getClientId();
         
    var params = {};
    params['popupId'] = popupId;
    var type = &quot;serverPopupClosed&quot;;
    var immediate = true;

    AdfCustomEvent.queue(source, type, params, immediate);
  }
&amp;lt;/af:resource&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;af:form&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;af:popup id=&quot;popup&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;af:dialog title=&quot;Test&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;f:verbatim&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/f:verbatim&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/af:dialog&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;af:clientListener method=&quot;popupClosedListener&quot; type=&quot;popupClosed&quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;af:serverListener type=&quot;serverPopupClosed&quot; method=&quot;#{testBean.serverPopupClosedListener}&quot;/&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;af:showPopupBehavior popupId=&quot;popup&quot;/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/af:button&amp;gt;       
&amp;lt;/af:form&amp;gt;
...
...
public void serverPopupClosedListener(ClientEvent event)
{
  String popupId = (String) event.getParameters().get(&quot;popupId&quot;);
  System.out.print(&quot;Popup Closed: &quot; + popupId);
}  		  
</pre></div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Server-side Popup Events<a name="Server-side_Popup_Events"></a></h3>
                  
<p></p>The <tt>PopupFetchEvent</tt> is one of two server-side popup events but doesn't have a corresponding client event.  
		     The popup fetch event is invoked during content delivery.  This means that the event will only queue for popups 
		     that have a <tt>contentDelivery</tt> type of <tt>lazy</tt> or <tt>lazyUncached</tt>.  Another caveat 
		     is that the event will only work when the launch id is set. This is automatically handled by the af:showPopupBehavior
                     but must be provided as a popup hint if programmatically shown.
	          
<p></p>The popup has two properties and a listener that work with this <tt>PopupFetchEvent</tt> event.  
		     The <tt>eventContext</tt> property is used to establish the currency that the <tt>popupFetchListener</tt> 
		     is invoked in.  This is a similar concept seen with stamped components such as the <tt>af:table</tt> component.  
		     In fact, this property allows creating a shared popup instance launched from a component within a <tt>af:table</tt> 
		     using the <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag.  The launcher component is placed in context and an instance made 
		     available using the popup's <tt>launcherVar</tt> property. 
                
<p></p>Besides the <tt>popupFetchListener</tt>, the <tt>af:setPropertyListener</tt> can be used to move a value 
		    from one place to another when the <tt>PopupFetchEvent</tt> is queued.

                The following example demonstrates using the popup fetch event:

<div class="source">
<pre>
&amp;lt;af:popup id=&quot;noteWindow&quot; contentDelivery=&quot;lazyUncached&quot; eventContext=&quot;launcher&quot; launcerVar=&quot;source&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;af:noteWindow&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;af:outputText value=&quot;#{testBean.fullName}&quot;/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/af:noteWindow&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;af:setPropertyListener from=&quot;#{source.attributes.fullName}&quot; to=&quot;#{testBean.fullName}&quot; type=&quot;popupFetch&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/af:popup&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;af:table var=&quot;person&quot; value=&quot;#{testBean.people}&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;af:column id=&quot;firstName&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;f:facet name=&quot;header&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;af:outputText value=&quot;First Name&quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/f:facet&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;af:link text=&quot;#{person.firstName}&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;af:showPopupBehavior popupId=&quot;::noteWindow&quot; triggerType=&quot;mouseHover&quot;/&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;af:clientAttribute name=&quot;fullName&quot; value=&quot;#{person.fullName}&quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/af:link&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/af:column&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/af:table&amp;gt;
                </pre></div>
                
                
<p></p>The <tt>PopupCanceledEvent</tt> is the second type of server-side event.  Unlike the <tt>PopupFetchEvent</tt>, it has a corresponding 
                client event.  The canceled event is fired when the popup is unexpectedly closed by auto-dismissal or by calling the cancel method 
                on the client component. Pressing the escape key will also cancel the popup.  
                
                
<p></p>The <tt>af:dialog</tt> and <tt>af:panelWindow</tt> extend this notion of unexpected dismissal to the cancel button and close icon.  
                For these components, selecting the cancel button (af:dialog only) or close icon will raise the canceled event.   
                
                
<p></p>The <tt>PopupCanceledEvent</tt> event has optimized event delivery meaning that it will not propagate to the server unless there are 
                server listeners registered for this event.  The canceled event is immediate but it will prevent processing of the reset of the 
                lifecycle on the popup's children whereby ignoring any submitted values and bypassing validation.  This event is also flagged as discrete.  
                Discrete events are sent to the server isolated in a single request.  They are never combined with multiple events in a single server request.
                
                The following example demonstrates using the popup canceled event:
                
<div class="source">
<pre>
&amp;lt;af:popup contentDelivery=&quot;lazyUncached&quot; eventContext=&quot;launcher&quot;

<h3>Popup Animations<a name="Popup_Animations"></a></h3>

<p></p>The popup open and close transition can be animated by configuring &lt;af:transition&gt; tag within a popup. 
   The af:transition tag will let you choose an animation style and what kind of transition will trigger what type of animation.
<b>Transition Trigger Types</b>

<ul>
  
<li>open - Transitioning popup to open popup</li>
  
<li>close - Transitioning popup from open state to close state.</li>
</ul>
<b>Transition Animations</b>

<ul>
  
<li>none - No animation while transitioning popup from one state to other. Also the type used if another specified animation type is not supported by popup transition.</li>
  
<li>auto - The default transition animation type. The popup animation grows diagonally while transitioning popup to open state. No animation while transitioning popup from open to close state</li>
  
<li>horizontally - While popup transitioning to open state, if popup is aligned right to the alignment element, then the popup open sliding animation will start from right and end towards left, and if popup is aligned left to the alignment element, then the popup open sliding animation will start from left and end towards right. When popup transitioning from open to close state, if popup is aligned right to the alignment element, then the popup close sliding animation will start from left and end towards right, and if popup is aligned left to the alignment element, then the popup close sliding animation will start from right and end towards left. If popup is configured not to be aligned with other element, then popup open sliding animation will start from left and end towards right, and close sliding animation will start from right and end towards left. (see note 1)</li>
  
<li>vertically - While popup transitioning to open state, if popup is aligned top to the alignment element, then the popup open sliding animation will start from bottom and end towards top, and if popup is aligned bottom to the alignment element, then the popup open sliding animation will start from top and end towards bottom. When popup transitioning from open to close state, if popup is aligned top to the alignment element, then the popup close sliding animation will start from top and end towards bottom, and if popup is aligned bottom to the alignment element, then the popup close sliding animation will start from bottom and end towards top. If popup is configured not to be aligned with other element, then popup open sliding animation will start from top and end towards bottom, and close sliding animation will start from bottom and end towards top. (see note 1)</li>
</ul>
Note:

<h2>Printable Pages&quot;<a name="Printable_Pages"></a></h2>
  Inline popups define content in the page that is hidden by default but when shown is layered above the
  primary document.  If you use an &lt;af:showPrintablePageBehavior&gt; within a popup, only the components within the popup
  will be present for printing when the user activates that behavior from a component within the popup.


<div class="section">
<h2>Layout Considerations&quot;<a name="Layout_Considerations"></a></h2>
  
<p></p>The popups dimensions are determined by the size of its content. There is no overflow in the content area.  This means 
  that the content area of the popup will not be scrollable or have the ability to clip its content.

  The default behavior for the popup is ideal for displaying read-only content but there are some caveats to watch for.
  
<ul>
    
<li>The popup will size to content. If the popups content is also stretching to the size of the of the parent popup 
        container, this combination results in an invalid layout that is inconsistently rendered across browsers. 
        The workaround for this issue is to add fixed dimensions to the root child content layout component that provides 
        scrolling or stretching (af:panelGroupLayout layout=scroll or af:panelStretchLayout).</li>
    
<li>The content container of the popup doesn't have having overflow or the ability to stretch its children.  This must
        be handled using the appropriate layout component within its content.</li>
  </ul>


<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management&quot;<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component cannot be stretched by a parent layout component because it stands alone on its own layer in the page.</li>

<li>This component does not have any support for stretching its children.</li>

<td>animate</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> default, false, true<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> default<br />
<br />Specifies the animation to be used for the popups. Animation of the popups is controlled by 
      system animation setting(&quot;animation-enabled&quot; in trinidad-config) and a skin property for individual popup types(af:menu, af:dailog, af:noteWindow etc).
      Use &quot;false&quot; to turn animation off for a popup regardless of the system settings. Use &quot;true&quot; to override the &quot;-tr-animate&quot; skin level property. The default value is &quot;default&quot;, which implies use the system settings and skin properties.</td>

<td>
a method reference to an attribute change listener.  Attribute change events are not delivered for any programmatic change to a property.  They are only delivered when a renderer changes a property without the application's specific request.  An example of an attribute change events might include the width of a column that supported client-side resizing.</td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> enabled, disabled<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> enabled<br />

             (full submit action command) or a DOM replacement (included in a PPR target).  
             Acceptable values include:
             
<ul>
               
<li>&quot;enabled&quot;: the popup will be implicitly canceled due to a dom replacement or document reload.</li>

<tr class="a">

<td>childCreation</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> immediate, deferred<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> immediate<br />
<br />Controls when the children are created. Introduces a server-side performance enhancement by postponing 
            construction of the components under the popup until its content is delivered whereby reducing the footprint of 
            server-side state.  
             Acceptable values include:
             
<ul>
               
<li>&quot;immediate&quot;: Children will always be added to the component tree.</li>

<td>clientComponent</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> false<br />
<br />whether a client-side component will be generated.  A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>contentDelivery</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> immediate, lazy, lazyUncached<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> lazy<br />
<br />whether the popup content is delivered with the initial page.  When contentDelivery is &quot;immediate&quot;, the content is inlined into the initial page.  If contentDelivery is &quot;lazy&quot;, the popup's content will be delivered to the client only after the first request to show that popup.  If contentDelivery is &quot;lazyUncached&quot;, the popup's content will be delivered fresh each and every time the popup is shown.  By default, contentDelivery is &quot;lazy&quot;, which means the content will not be sent to the client up front, but will be cached once loaded. In &quot;attachment&quot; mode, popups content delivery is forced to be &quot;immediate&quot;. Therefore, popups that display data in context using &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;lazyUncached&quot; content delivery must be refactored to establish contextual state with javascript acting on client component events such as &quot;popupOpening&quot;.</td>

<td>eventContext</td>
<td>String</td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> self, launcher<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> self<br />
<br />
<p></p>
      Whether events delivered by the popup and its descendents are delivered in the context of the launch source.
      
<p></p>
      What does 'in context' mean? In something like a table, for example, when an event is delivered 'in context' 
      then the data for the row clicked is made 'current' before the event listener is called, 
      so if getRowData() is called on the collectionModel in the event listener it will return the data 
      of the row that triggered the event.
      
<p></p>
      In the case of a shared popup you really want the popup to 'act' as if it's been reparented to the launch 
      source when the popup opens. In other words, you want any event from the popup delivered in the context 
      of the launch source so that you can access data available to the launch source. When eventContext is 
      set to 'launcher' both the popupFetch event and events fired from inside the popup are delivered in 
      the context of the launch source.

<html>the identifier for the component.  Every component may be named by a component identifier that must conform to the following rules:

<ul>

<li>They must start with a letter (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method) or underscore ( _ ).</li>

<li>Subsequent characters must be letters (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method), digits as defined by the Character.isDigit() method, 
dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers 
be as short as possible. If a component has been given an identifier, it must be unique in the namespace of the closest ancestor to that component 
that is a NamingContainer (if any).</li>

Name of the variable used to reference the launch component on the request, which makes it EL reachable.
      The launch component refers to the component that launched the popup. 
      This variable is only available during event delivery on the popup or its descendents, 
      outside of event delivery this variable is removed (or reverted back to its previous value). 
      This value is only available when the eventContext is set to 'launcher'.
      If this value is not set, then the launch component is not made available on the request during event delivery.</td>

<tr class="b">

<td>partialTriggers</td>
<td>String[]</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the IDs of the components that should trigger a partial update.
        This component will listen on the trigger components. If one of the
        trigger components receives an event that will cause it to update
        in some way, this component will request to be updated too.
        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of
        two naming containers (including itself if the component is a naming container)
        and begin the search from there, etc.</td>
