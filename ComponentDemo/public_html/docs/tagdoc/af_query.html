The query component provides the user the ability to perform a query based on a saved 
          search or personalize saved searches. The component displays a search panel with various 
          elements, each of which help the user to accomplish various tasks.
          
          
<p></p>To properly render the query panel when content width is more than view area, it should 
          be wrapped in a af:panelGroupLayout with layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;. For ex:
          
<div class="source">

 &amp;lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot; inlineStyle=&quot;width:100%&quot; &amp;gt;

<ul>
              
<li>
                Search Panel: the panel that encloses all elements rendered by the query component 
              </li>
              
<li>
                Search Header: Spans the entire width of the search panel and used to display a 
                disclosure icon, the label, search mode (toggle button) and saved search (choice 
                list of saved searches). The help (deprecated), info and toolbar facets' content is 
                also displayed in the header.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Match Type: A radio button group that appears below the search header, it defines 
                whether the search criteria should be treated as an AND search or an OR search. For 
                details on the conjunction operators refer to the QueryDescriptor and 
                ConjunctionCriterion classes.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Criteria region: A form layout that appears below the Match type, it contains search
                fields that define the search parameters. For details on search fields refer to the 
                QueryDescriptor model.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Criterion: A criterion represents a single search field, that comprises of an operator and
                one or more value fields. For value fields that render LOV components, the autoComplete
                feature is not enabled unless either of the methods, AttributeCriterion.hasDependentCriterion() 
                or ListOfValuesModel.isAutoCompleteEnabled() return true. This is done to allow the end-user 
                to enter partial values with wild-cards and tab around the search panel without causing the 
                LOV dialog to be launched (everytime they tab-out of the LOV value field).
              </li>
              
<li>
                Action buttons: The search panel has four action buttons: Search, Reset, Save, and 
                Add Fields. The action buttons appear below the criteria region. They are 
                end-aligned within the search header.

<h2>Tasks performed using a query component<a name="Tasks_performed_using_a_query_component"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>The following actions are performed on the currently selected saved search.
            
<ul>
              
<li>
                Perform Search: Executes a query based on the search criteria (values entered for 
                the search fields). Exposed as the Search button
              </li>
              
<li>
                Add Criterion: Adds the selected attribute (represented by an AttributeDescriptor) 
                as a criterion to the current saved search in the search panel (represented by a 
                QueryDescriptor object). The query component by default registers an internal 
                ActionListener for the associated ActionEvent and invokes the addCriterion method in 
                the QueryDescriptor.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Remove Criterion: Removes the search field (aka AttributeCriterion). The user can 
                click the remove butcon that appears next to certain search fields. The query 
                component by default registers an internal ActionListener for the ActionEvent that 
                is fired as part of the delete and invokes the deleteCriterion method in the 
                QueryDescriptor.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Toggle Mode: Toggles the mode of the search panel between Basic and Advanced
              </li>
              
<li>
                Change Conjunction: Changes the conjunction operator to be used when executing a 
                query.
              </li>
            </ul>
          
<p></p>The following actions are performed on saved searches:
            
<ul>
              
<li>
                Create: Create a new saved search based on the current search criteria used on the 
                search panel. Exposed as the Save.. button on the Search panel.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Reset: Resets the saved search to its default state. Exposed as the Reset button.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Select: Saved searches (displayed in a choice list on the search panel header) can 
                be changed. This allows the user to update the criteria to match that of the 
                selected saved search. The action may also execute the search depending on how the 
                saved search is configured.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Personalize a saved search: The &quot;Personalize...&quot; option is displayed in the Saved 
                Search choice list. Selecting this option opens the &quot;Personalize Saved Searches&quot; 
                dialog, which allows user to personalize the saved search in the following ways.
                
<ul>
                  
<li>
                    Update a Saved Search: Change the name and UIHints for the selected saved search. 
                    Users are prevented from updating a saved search that is marked as immutable. 
                    The Apply and Ok buttons can be used to commit the changes.
                  </li>
                  
<li>
                    Delete a Saved Search: delete the selected saved search (by using the Delete 
                    button). Users are prevented from changing a system saved search. 
                  </li>
                  
<li> 	 
                    Duplicate a Saved Search: Clone the selected saved search (by using the 	 
                    Duplicate button).

            QueryOperationEvent is fired for operations performed on saved searches. The operations
            include changeMode, create, duplicate, delete, reset, select and update. The specific 
            operation that triggers this event is stored as part of the QueryOperationEvent object.
            The query component by default registers an internal QueryOperationListener and invokes 
            specific methods on the QueryModel. Please refer to the QueryModel for more details. 
          
<p></p>
            QueryEvent is fired in response to the user action to perform a query. For e.g., when 
            the user hits the Search button or if the currently selected saved search is configured
            to &quot;Run Automatically&quot; when selected in the Saved Search choice list.

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.

precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant

        Product teams should ensure that this value is set correctly so that the search operation

            usage of the shortDesc attribute.

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>
