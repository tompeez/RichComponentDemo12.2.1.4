<h2>Summary<a name="Summary"></a></h2>
         
<p>
            <b>Tag name:</b>
            &lt;af:showPopupBehavior&gt;
            <br />
            
<p>The <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag is a declarative way to show a <tt>af:popup</tt> in response to a client-side event.  
                             The client event is specified using the <tt>triggerType</tt> attribute. The &quot;action&quot; event is the default <tt>triggerType</tt> if 
                             one is not provided. When the <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag is associated with a component, the popup specified via the 
                             <tt>popupId</tt> attribute will automatically be shown when the associated client event is activated.   
                             This tag only acts on client events similar to the <tt>af:clientListener</tt> tag.</p>

                       
<div class="section">
<h3>Popup Alignment<a name="Popup_Alignment"></a></h3>
                       
<p>The tag's <tt>alignId</tt> and <tt>align</tt> attributes are used to specify the location a popup should be opened.  These attributes 
                              are required for most types of popups (See <tt>af:popup</tt> for popup types).  However, there are a few exceptions to this rule.  
                              The <tt>af:dialog</tt> and <tt>af:panelWindow</tt> popup types do not require alignment attributes.  These types of popups 
                             can be manually repositioned using drag-and-drop and will open by default at the center of the browser window.  The third exception that doesn't 
                             require alignment attributes is for popup's using the &quot;contextMenu&quot; <tt>triggerType</tt>.  The &quot;contextMenu&quot; event is fired on a right 
                             mouse click.  For this trigger type, popup alignment is by mouse position.</p>  

                       </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Popup Tail<a name="Popup_Tail"></a></h3>
                       
<p>The tag's <tt>tail</tt> attribute is used to specify whether popup tail has to be shown or not. The default value will be &quot;none&quot;.
                              The popup tail will be positioned based on the final alignment value.</p>      
  
                       </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Cancels Client Events<a name="Cancels_Client_Events"></a></h3>
                       
<p>The <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag cancels the client event defined by the <tt>triggerType</tt>.  Canceling the client event will prevent 
                             delivery to the server.  This is significant for action events raised by command family components because the server-side action listeners will be ignored.  
                            All <tt>actionListener</tt> method bindings and associated action listeners will not be invoked when the <tt>triggerType</tt> of  &quot;action&quot; is used.</p>  

                         </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Subscriber of Client Events<a name="Subscriber_of_Client_Events"></a></h3>
                         
<p>The <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag is only a subscriber of component events meaning that it can only react to client component events.  
                               The various client events and sequences in which client events are raised are component specific, unknown to the <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag.  
                               Developers that need to also trigger server-side functionality can either use manual JavaScript to show a popup, or add an additional 
                               <tt>af:clientListener</tt> that uses <tt>AdfCustomEvent</tt> and <tt>af:serverListener</tt> to deliver a server-side event.</p>

                         </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Special Behaviors<a name="Special_Behaviors"></a></h3>
                          
<p>The various types of popup's have built in &quot;behaviors&quot; such as auto-dismissal and if the popup steals focus when shown.  There is a special 
                             behavior added to the <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag when working with an inline selector type of popup.  An inline selector type of popup 
                             will toggle visibility of the associated popup if the popup is already shown. So, if you are using this tag with a command button and use the
                             default triggerType of &quot;action&quot;, the first click on the launching command will show the popup.  A second click on the command will hide the popup.
                             This behavior only applies to the inline selector type of popup used with the <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag.  To learn more about the types 
                             of popups see the <a href="af_popup.html">af:popup</a> tag documentation.</p>

                          
<p>A single popup can be opened by several launching sources using the <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag.  If a popup is already visible and a request to open using a 
                                 <tt>showPopupBehavior</tt> tag from another launching source is made, the shared popup will be dismissed before showing again.  If the popup 
                                  is already visible and another request to show it is made from the same launching source the request is ignored (excluding the inline selector).</p>

                            
<p>The &quot;mouseOver&quot; or &quot;mouseHover&quot; event types have a built in 500-millisecond launch delay that is implicitly canceled if a &quot;mouseOut&quot; event is triggered for the same 
                                   component within the delay period.</p>

                              
<p>All popup types have determined auto-dismissal behaviors.  See the <tt>af:popup</tt> tag documentation for a breakdown of popup types and assumed behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If EL is used in the EL supported attributes of this tag, this tag will <b>not</b> be stampable.</p>

<h3>Examples:<a name="Examples:"></a></h3>

<div class="section">
<h3>Accessibility Guidelines<a name="Accessibility_Guidelines"></a></h3>
         
<p>Trigger types action/contextInfo are recommended over other native trigger types as it is more accessible. Trigger types of <b>mouseHover</b>, <b>mouseMove</b>, <b>mouseOver</b>, and <b>mouseOut</b> may cause unwanted and unexpected 
            visits away from the host page to a popup screen. If you use one of these triggerTypes, make sure you provide alternate access to the same content.
         </p>
         
<p>Do not create popups that are only available by mouse! If you are using one of the mouse triggerTypes, make sure that
            your popup is also accessible via the keyboard. For example, if you want to display a noteWindow on mouseOver, you could setup two showPopupBehavior tags, one triggering on mouseOver and one triggering on action, so that a keyboard only can also access the popup.
         </p>
         
<p>Do not show a popup on <b>focus</b> or <b>blur</b> event types. This will cause a change in context making your application hard to use by a keyboard only user, and confusing for someone using a screen reader. While these are available event types, they should not be used in any real application with showPopupBehavior.
