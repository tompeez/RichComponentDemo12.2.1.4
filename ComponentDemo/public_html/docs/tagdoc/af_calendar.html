          The calendar component provides the user the ability to view a user's activities by day,
          week, month, or list or flexList. The 'view' attribute controls whether day, week, month, or list is shown.
          
<p></p>
          The 'activeDay' attribute drives the display range shown. For example to display the month of June 2008 in 'month' view, the activeDay must be a day in June 2008. The activeDay is also the specific date that will be shown in 'day' view.
          
<p></p>
          The value attribute of the calendar component binds to an oracle.adf.view.rich.model.CalendarModel
          which contains oracle.adf.view.rich.model.CalendarActivity model objects, and the calendar
          knows how to render a calendarActivity. The public static method
          CalendarModel.isActivityInRange is provided as a convenience. You should use it when you need
          to decide if a CalendarActivity is in a certain date range,
           e.g., from your implementation of CalendarModel's method getTimeActivities.
          
<p></p>
          The calendar does not control how activities are created, edited, or deleted,
          but it does fire events to allow you to wire up creating,
          editing, and deleting activities. As a convenience the calendar supports several
          facets, all of which should contain popups. There is more specific documentation
          about the facets in the &quot;Supported Facets&quot; section.


<div class="section">
<h2>Activity Style Customization<a name="Activity_Style_Customization"></a></h2>

      
<p></p>
      The activityStyles attribute can be used to customize the look of an acitivty instance.
      The activityStyles attribute type is Map&lt;Set&lt;String&gt;, InstanceStyles&gt;.
      The InstanceStyles object in the map can return per activity styles. Please
      see the javadoc on InstanceStyles and CalendarActivityRamp for information on those classes.
      
<p></p>
      So how do we set up the activityStyles attribute so that it returns the appropriate
      InstanceStyles object for a given activity?
      Let's say we have 3 providers, &quot;Me&quot;, &quot;Larry&quot;, and &quot;Ted&quot;, and we want to show
      the activities for these as red, orange, and blue respectively.
      You would create a map with the following key/value pairs and bind it to the activityStyles attribute:
      
<table border="0" class="bodyTable" summary=""><tbody>
      
<tr class="a">
      
<th>Key(String Set)</th>
      
<th> Value (InstanceStyles Object)</th>
      </tr>
      
<tr class="b">
      
<td>{&quot;Me&quot;} </td>
      
<td> CalendarActivityRamp.getActivityRamp(CalendarActivityRamp.RampKey.RED) </td>
      </tr>
      
<tr class="a">
      
<td>{&quot;Larry&quot;} </td>
      
<td> CalendarActivityRamp.getActivityRamp(CalendarActivityRamp.RampKey.ORANGE) </td>
      </tr>
      
<tr class="b">
      
<td>{&quot;Ted&quot;} </td>
      
<td> CalendarActivityRamp.getActivityRamp(CalendarActivityRamp.RampKey.BLUE) </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody></table>
      
<p></p>
      Additionally you would set up the activities such that the
      string set returned from the getTags method matches the string set
      keys in the activityStyles map, for example:
      
<ul>
        
<li>a &quot;Me&quot; activity returns the string set {&quot;Me&quot;} from the getTags() method</li>
        
<li>a &quot;Larry&quot; activity returns the string set {&quot;Larry&quot;} from the getTags() method</li>
        
<li>a &quot;Ted&quot; activity returns the string set {&quot;Ted&quot;} from the getTags() method</li>
      </ul>
      
<p></p>
      During calendar rendering for each activity the renderer calls CalendarActivity.getTags
      to get a string set. The string set is then passed to the activityStyles map
      and an InstanceStyles object is returned
      (keep in mind that CalendarActivityRamp is a subclass of InstanceStyles),
      so in our example:
      
<ul>
        
<li>if we pass in the string set {&quot;Me&quot;} we get back the red CalendarActivityRamp.</li>
        
<li>if we pass in the string set {&quot;Larry&quot;} we get back the orange CalendarActivityRamp.</li>
        
<li>if we pass in the string set {&quot;Me&quot;} we get back the blue CalendarActivityRamp.</li>
      </ul>



<div class="section">
<h2>Drag and Drop<a name="Drag_and_Drop"></a></h2>
  
<p></p>
    The calendar supports 2 types of dragging.
    
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      
<li>Moving a calendar activity - in this case the activity is moved to a new start date/time. This type of drag and drop requires that a calendarDropTarget is attached to the calendar. If there is no calendarDropTarget then this type of drag and drop is disabled. See the calendarDropTarget doc for more information.</li>
      
<li>Duration drag - in this case the end time is dragged to resize the activity. The     calendarActivityDurationChange event is delivered when the user resizes an
        activity on the client. The activity is immediately moved/resized on the client and an event is queued on the server.
        You are expected to update the activity based on new end Dates.
        If there is no listener for CalendarActivityDurationChangeEvents then this type of dragging is disabled. </li>
    </ol>


<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children, e.g. the panelStretchLayout.</li>

<li>If this component is not a child of a parent layout component that stretches its children, it will have a default width and height,
and cannot be stretched by the end user.
You can override the default width and height
if the calendar component is not being stretched by a parent component
by setting the inlineStyle attribute, e.g., inlineStyle=&quot;width:300px; height: 400px&quot;.
If the component is being stretched by a parent component and
you try to override the default width and height then you may accidentally
specify one or more indeterminate dimensions without knowing it
(e.g. having all non-auto values for width, left, and right
and/or all non-auto values for height, top, and bottom).
</li>
</ul>


<div class="section">
<h2>Low Level Events<a name="Low_Level_Events"></a></h2>

  
<p></p>
The calendar does not fire &quot;high level&quot; events, for example it does not fire specific events for
edit, delete, create, context menu, etc. Instead calendar fires  the &quot;low level&quot;
Calendar and CalendarActivity events.
  
<p></p>
    Let's take a calendarActivity. A calendarActivityEvent will be queued if the user does any of the following on a calendarActivity
    
<ul>
    
<li>clicks</li>
    
<li>right clicks</li>
    
<li>focuses and presses a key</li>
    </ul>
    
<p></p>
    Even though a calendarActivityEvent is queued for all these, you can tell these apart because keyboard, mouse, and triggerType information will also be available in the event.
    
<p></p>
    Although you are free to wire up your own ui response (for example showing a popup) to an event,
    for convenience the component has several facets that have been wired to show for common ui gestures.
    See the &quot;Supported Facets&quot; section for details.

<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children. e.g. panelStretchLayout, panelSplitter.</li>

<li>This component does not have support for stretching its children.</li>

<tr class="b">

<td>oracle.adf.view.rich.event.CalendarActivityEvent</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap">Invoke Application</td>
<td>The calendarActivity event is delivered when the user acts on a 
              calendar activity, for example clicks on an activity. 
              
<p>
              PPR behavior:  In general the calendar doesn't know if anything visible will change
              when this event is handled, for example if the start time is changed then the calendar needs 
              to be ppr'ed, but if the description changes, then it does not need to be ppr'ed.
              Therefore in general the calendar does not add itself as a ppr target, 
              the app developer must therefore  PPR the calendar if it is needed.               
              </p>
              
<p>
              There is one exception when the calendar will add itself as a ppr target, which is 
              if the  CalendarActivity cannot be found in the model. For example let's say 2 users are looking 
              at the same data. User A deletes activity 1, then User B clicks on activity 1, but
              the activity has been deleted, so CalendarModel.getActivity will return null.
              In this case the calendar will add itself as a ppr target since the end user
              is trying to interact with an activity that is no longer available.
              </p></td></tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>oracle.adf.view.rich.event.CalendarDisplayChangeEvent</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap">Invoke Application</td>
<td>The calendarDisplayChange event is delivered when the calendar component 
              changes the value of an attribute on the calendar. For example the view
              attribute may be changed from month to day if the user hits the day button
              in the toolbar. Another example is the next button in the toolbar
              is pressed, which causes the calendar to update the activeDay.               
              
<p>
              Note that when these attributes are set by the calendar they are only set locally 
              on the component, and the component no longer pulls the value from the EL expression. 
              This is common practice, for example when you click on the +/- on a showDetail, 
              disclosed is being set locally on the component to true/false by the framework. 
              In order to save these local values you must use the change management framework.
              </p>
              
<p>
              PPR behavior: Generally, if a calendarDisplayChange
              event is fired then the calendar will add itself as a ppr target. 
              This is because if the calendar changes the value of activeDate or view,
              there is no doubt that the calendar will need to be re-rendered.

        PPR behavior: The calendar does not get PPR'd automatically when this event is fired since
        the calendar doesn't know if anything visible will change when this event is handled.
         You must PPR the calendar in the event listener if the calendar needs to be re-rendered to
         show any visible changes, like if a new activity was created.

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and

        showActivityTypes also controls the display of all-day, time activities region and the splitter. For example

      The built in strings the component recognizes are:

<li>&quot;all&quot; - all the buttons calendar provides by default - if &quot;all&quot; is in the list,
                     the built in strings 'range', 'dates', and 'views' are ignored</li>

<li>&quot;stretch&quot; - adds a stretched component</li>

<p></p>
        Custom toolbox content: when the calendar encounters a string in toolboxLayout
        that it doesn't recognize, like 'customToolbarXyz', it looks for a facet of
        that name and renders the content if it finds it. In the future new facets may
        be added to calendar. In order to avoid future name clashes strings starting
        with the word 'custom' should be used for custom facets. We make no guarantees
        for other names.

        The toolboxLayout attribute allows the user to
        
<ul>
          
<li>add as many custom toolbars as desired, for example

<li>toolboxLayout=&quot;all newline customToolbar newline customGroup&quot;</li>

          </ul>

<li>show multiple rows of toolbars. for example

<li>toolboxLayout=&quot;customToolbar1 newline all&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
