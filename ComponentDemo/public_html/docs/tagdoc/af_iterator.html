 RichIterator is a component that performs iteration over its child components. It is similar to UIXTable
but has no chrome.
 Each child is repeatedly stamped as many times as necessary.
 Iteration is done starting at the index given by the &quot;first&quot; attribute,
 for as many indices as specified by the &quot;rows&quot; attribute.
 If &quot;rows&quot; returns 0, then the iteration continues until 
 there are no more elements in the underlying data.
 
<p></p> 
  While the &lt;tr:forEach&gt;
will be sufficient for most user's needs, it does not work with a JSF
DataModel, or CollectionModel. It also cannot be bound to EL expressions that
use component-managed EL variables
(such as the &quot;var&quot; variable on an &lt;tr:table&gt;), because
a forEach tag runs during
The &lt;tr:iterator&gt; tag was created to
address these issues.

<p></p>
To list all, the benefits of UIXIterator over forEach:

<ul>

<li>Access to component-managed EL variables</li>

<li>Full support for CollectionModel and DataModel</li>

<li>Does not require creating multiple copies of children,
so more memory efficient</li>

<li>Much better at dealing with adding and deleting children,
at least when used with a CollectionModel with a good
implementation of getRowKey()</li>

<li>Supports &quot;binding&quot;, and all other forms of JSF component
manipulation</li>
</ul>
and the negative aspects:

<ul>

<li>Leaves behind a component in the hierarchy, which causes
problems with components like panelFormLayout that try to handle each child
individually.</li>

<li>Because there's only one of each child, the same limitations
on &quot;binding&quot;, etc., as apply inside a table also apply to iterator.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>By default, it processes up to 25 rows. Use the rows attribute to alter this behavior.

          The VarStatus provides contextual information about the state of the
          component to EL expressions. For components that iterate, varStatus
          also provides loop counter information.  Please see the this 
          component's documentation for the specific properties on the varStatus.
          The common properties on varStatus include:
          
<ul>
            
<li>&quot;model&quot; - returns the CollectionModel for this component.</li>
