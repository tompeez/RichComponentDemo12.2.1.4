            A menuBar is a single row container designed to hold menus, commandMenuItems, 
            goMenuItems, and groups of these same components. MenuBars are not rendered on printable 
            pages. 
          
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Usage with a MenuModel<a name="Usage_with_a_MenuModel"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            The MenuModel implementation is also supported, namely
            org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.XmlMenuModel. Notice that the MenuModel has no
            special knowledge of page navigation and places no requirements on the nodes that go
            into the tree. The nodes in the tree are stamped out using the 'nodeStamp' facet,
            which should contain a commandNavigationItem component. This allows the default
            actionListener mechanism to be used for page navigation. 
          
          
<p></p>
          <b>Note</b>: The attributes 'var', 'value' and 'varStatus' are applicable only when
            attaching the menuBar to a menu model. Please also note that within a single menuBar
            component there could be either a menu model attached or explicitly defined children
            (viz. menus, commandMenuItems, goMenuItems, and groups of these same components).
          
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Allowed Children<a name="Allowed_Children"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            A menuBar is designed to only hold menus, commandMenuItems, goMenuItems, and groups of 
            these same components, as well as simple decorative (non focusable) components like 
            image and spacer. A menuBar can also dynamically add children of these allowed types 
            using a facetRef, iterator, or switcher. The support for commandNavigationItems as
            children is only provided when menu model is used.
          
          
<p></p>
            Besides the components listed, other types of children are not allowed. This is because 
            the menuBar provides special menu functionality, like open menu mode, menu type access 
            key behavior, and arrow key support that will not function correctly if other components 
            are included on the menuBar. If you would like to include a non-menu-type component next 
            to a menuBar, you can do this instead by placing the item in an adjacent toolbar next 
            to the menuBar in the same toolbox row group.
          
          
<p></p>
            Please note that you should not nest toolbars, menuBars, or other container-type 
            components inside a menuBar. This is incompatible with overflow and is not supported. 
            If you would like to display multiple menuBars or toolbars in a single row, you should 
            instead use a toolbox group.
          
          
<p></p>
          <b>Note</b>: In the case of a menuBar attached to a menu model only commandNavigationItems
            can be contained inside the &quot;nodeStamp&quot; facet. This is due to the reason that almost
            every groupNode and itemNode attribute (of a menu model) corresponds to an equivalent
            attribute of the commandNavigationItem.
          
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Special Menu Functionality<a name="Special_Menu_Functionality"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            MenuBars provide special menu functionality, including open menu mode, menu type access 
            key behavior, and arrow key support. 
          
          
<div class="section">
<h3>Open Menu Mode<a name="Open_Menu_Mode"></a></h3>
          
<p></p>
            When you open a menu from the menuBar using the mouse, the menuBar is then in open menu 
            mode. If you then move the mouse over another menu on the menuBar, the old menu 
            automatically closes and the newly highlighted menu opens. 
          
          </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Menu Type Access Key Behavior<a name="Menu_Type_Access_Key_Behavior"></a></h3>
          
<p></p>
            With menu type access key behavior, once your keyboard focus is in a menuBar or menu, 
            you can simply press the access key without modifiers to move the focus to the menu item 
            in that menu or menubar with that access key. 
          
          </div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Keyboard Access<a name="Keyboard_Access"></a></h3>
          
<p></p>
            MenuBars are a single tabstop, with arrow key support to move focus between menuBar items.
            Arrow keys provide convenient keyboard focus movement between items in a menuBar and its 
            child menus. The left and right arrow keys access the items on the menuBar. When arrowing 
            beyond the last (or first) menuBar item, the focus is moved to the next (or previous) tab 
            stop outside the menuBar. Pressing the down arrow opens a menu and moves keyboard focus 
            to the first item. You can then press the up and down arrow keys to cycle through the menu 
            items. Pressing left or right arrow keys inside a menu normally closes that menu and 
            returns focus to the menu item on the menBar. Pressing the right arrow key while on a 
            submenu item will open that submenu instead and place focus on its first item. 
          
          
<p></p>
          <b>Note</b>: The above special functionality does not work for menuBar attached to a menu
            model. The menu model implementation has 'hover to open and click to navigate&quot; behavior.
            On hovering over any nested itemNode the popup opens up and navigation happens on a
            click. If a nested item has keyboard focus, it just highlights. The popup opens only
            when down arrow(for top bar items) or right arrow(for inner menu items) is pressed and 
            navigation happens on pressing enter key. The arrow key support is very much similar to
            what is mentioned above except that we have commandNavigationItems instead of menus and
            menuItems.
          
          </div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Grouping Items in a MenuBar<a name="Grouping_Items_in_a_MenuBar"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            If you use an <tt>&lt;af:group&gt;</tt> to group items inside a menuBar, the menuBar 
            will by default include separators around the group. You should also note that the group 
            has an effect on certain items. For example, commandMenuItems with type of radio that 
            are grouped together are automatically considered part of the same radio group. 
          
          
<p></p>
            By default visual group separators always appear. If you want a group but do not want 
            the group separator to appear, you can set the group's startBoundary or endBoundary 
            attributes to 'hide' to request that the corresponding boundary be hidden. Note that 
            when a first group's endBoundary and a second group's startBoundary are both set, the 
            separator will only be hidden if both values are set to 'hide' or one value is 'hide'
            while the other value is 'dontCare'.
          
          
<p></p>
            Grouping items is not supported for a menuBar attached to a menu model.
          
          
<div class="section">
<h2>MenuBar Layout<a name="MenuBar_Layout"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            MenuBars were designed to be used inside an <tt>&lt;af:toolbox&gt;</tt>. A toolbox 
            allows highly customizable display of menuBars, by utilizing their flex values and 
            allowing multiple menuBars and toolbars per row. 
          
          
<p></p>
            You may use a menuBar outside of a toolbox, though doing so will cause the menuBar to 
            lose the geometry management functionality that the toolbox provides. Without a toolbox, 
            you cannot have multiple menuBars per row or benefit from flex values.
          
          
<p></p>
            Because menuBars and toolboxes are overflow components, they do not have a set width 
            size. A menuBar or toolbox should be placed in a section of the page where it can 
            horizontally stretch to the available size for proper rendering. Putting a menuBar or 
            toolbox inside a section of the page where it is horizontally constrained to a minimum 
            size (like a panelStretchLayout end facet) will be error-prone, due to the fact that the 
            width of the menuBar varies with its current overflow state.
          
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Right Justifying Menubar Items<a name="Right_Justifying_Menubar_Items"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            By default menuBars are left (start side) justified. In order to make some or all of the 
            menuBar items right (end side) justified, you can use the stretchId attibute. StretchId 
            is usually set to the id of an af:spacer on the menuBar that you want to stretch to take 
            up any available extra horizontal space. The component that you specify must be present 
            on the client. Therefore, if using a component that may not be present on the client 
            (like af:spacer), you should set the child component's clientComponent attribute to 
            'true'.
          
          
<p></p>
            Note that stretchId is not applicable for menu model implementations of menuBar.

<h2>Assigning Percent Values to Items in a Row<a name="Assigning_Percent_Values_to_Items_in_a_Row"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            When used inside a toolbox row, you can use a flex value on a menuBar to control what 
            percentage of the available horizontal space that menuBar should receive. For example, 
            if your toolbox row has 1 menuBar and 2 toolbars, each with a flex value of &quot;1&quot;, then 
            they receive their flex value (1) of the total space available (3). This means that the 
            menuBar (and each toolbar) would be given one third of the available horizontal space. 
          
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Updating through PartialTriggers<a name="Updating_through_PartialTriggers"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            Note that if a menuBar child component is going to be updated through partial page 
            rendering, you need to update the menuBar as well. You do this by adding the child 
            components id to the menuBar's partialTriggers attribute. This way the menuBar can 
            appropriately manage its children in respect to sizing and placement in overflow. 
          
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>
            
<ul>
              
<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches 
                its children, e.g. panelStretchLayout, panelSplitter.</li>
              
<li>This component most commonly accepts menus, commandMenuItems, and goMenuItems 
                as children. Other visual children include spacers and images. Children are not by 
                default stretched. This component also has a stretchId attribute. When this 
                attribute is set to the id of one of its children, that child is stretched.</li>
            </ul>
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Overflow&quot;<a name="Overflow"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>MenuBar is an overflow component. When a menuBar does not have enough space to 
            display all items, the children are put into overflow and an overflow button is 
            displayed. When a menuBar in a toolbox row has a flex value, the flex value is strictly 
            followed, even in regards to overflow. When menuBars (or toolbars) in a toolbox row do 
            not have flex values, then the right most (end side) menuBar would be forced into 
            overflow before left side menuBars. Spacer and image children on menuBars are not put
            into overflow.
          
<p></p>Overflow components must be part of a supported layout in order to work 
                  properly on the page.
          
<p></p>An overflow component requires that it is either:
          
<ul>
          
<li>in a container that stretches its children, or</li>
          
<li>in a container that has a set width.</li>
          </ul>
          
<p></p>Under these circumstances, when the overflow component is larger than the parent container, 
                  the overflow component will display an overflow button. Selecting the overflow button will 
                  show a popup containing the items that didn't fit on the page.
          
<p></p>Setting up an overflow component with the following layouts is not supported. If you use one 
                  of these layouts, you may have unexpected and inconsistent results:
          
<ul>
          
<li>in a container that does not stretch its children.</li>
          
<li>in a container that displays multiple children horizontally without explicit sizes 
                   for each child. For example, a panelGroupLayout with layout='horizontal' would be 
                   invalid, but panelSplitter is OK because it has an explicitly set splitter position.</li>
          
<li>setting the overflow component with a styleClass or inlineStyle that assigns a 
                   percentage width value. Note that this includes assigning 
                   styleClass='AFStretchWidth' on an overflow component.</li>

<td>
a method reference to an attribute change listener.  Attribute change events are not delivered for any programmatic change to a property.  They are only delivered when a renderer changes a property without the application's specific request.  An example of an attribute change events might include the width of a column that supported client-side resizing.</td>

from a backing bean, or to move creation of the component to a backing bean.</td>

<td>clientComponent</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> false<br />
<br />whether a client-side component will be generated.  A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

<b>Default Value:</b> 0<br />
<br />a non-negative integer that indicates the flexibility of this component in its 
        containing toolbox. When in a toolbox, flex is used to determine how horizontal space is 
        distributed among toolbox children in the same row. Components with larger flex values will 
        be assigned more horizontal space than components with lower flex values. This is done using
        the ratio determined by the flex of each of the child components. The actual value is only 
        relevant if there are other flexible components (components with flex values larger than 
        zero) within the same container.</td>

<html>the identifier for the component.  Every component may be named by a component identifier that must conform to the following rules:

<ul>

<li>They must start with a letter (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method) or underscore ( _ ).</li>

<li>Subsequent characters must be letters (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method), digits as defined by the Character.isDigit() method, 
dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers 
be as short as possible. If a component has been given an identifier, it must be unique in the namespace of the closest ancestor to that component 
that is a NamingContainer (if any).</li>

<tr class="a">

<td>inlineStyle</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the CSS styles to use for this component. This
is intended for basic style changes. The inlineStyle is a set of CSS styles
that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>partialTriggers</td>
<td>String[]</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the IDs of the components that should trigger a partial update.
        This component will listen on the trigger components. If one of the
        trigger components receives an event that will cause it to update
        in some way, this component will request to be updated too.
        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of
        two naming containers (including itself if the component is a naming container)
        and begin the search from there, etc.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>rendered</td>
<td>boolean</td>

<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />whether the component is rendered. When set to false, no output will be
		delivered for this component (the component will not in any way be rendered,
		and cannot be made visible on the client). If you want to change a component's
		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the
                parent refreshes and in turn will render this component.</td>

<tr class="b">

<td>shortDesc</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

<td>
the id of a child component that will be given all of the available space left in 
        the menuBar if the contents of the menuBar do not use all of the space that the menuBar has 
        available. The component that you specify must be present on the client. Therefore, if using 
        a component that may not be present on the client (like af:spacer), you should set the child 
        component's clientComponent attribute to 'true'. This attribute is not applicable for menu 
        model implementation of menuBar.</td>

<td>styleClass</td>

a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can
                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you
                     can use one of our public style classes, like 'AFInstructionText'.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>unsecure</td>
<td>java.util.Set</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

        its previous value). This attribute is only needed when attaching the menuBar to a menu model.</td>

<tr class="b">

<td>varStatus</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>
Name of the EL variable used to reference the varStatus information. Once this component
        has completed rendering, this variable is removed (or reverted back to its previous value).
        The VarStatus provides contextual information about the state of the component to EL
        expressions. For components that iterate, varStatus also provides loop counter information.
        Please see the this component's documentation for the specific properties on the varStatus.
        The common properties on varStatus include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;model&quot; - returns the CollectionModel
        for this component</li>
<li>&quot;index&quot; - returns the zero based row index</li></ul>
        This attribute is only needed when attaching the menuBar to a menu model.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>visible</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
