<p></p>The inputComboboxListOfValues component allows a user to open a choice list and select
          from a list of values, in order to populate the LOV field (and possibly other fields) on a
          page. <br />
          Users can either select a value from the list in the dropdown panel or click the &quot;Search...&quot;
          link at the bottom of the panel to launch the &quot;Search and Select&quot; dialog. The dropdown panel
		  can be opened by clicking the dropdown icon or pressing 'ALT + down arrow'. The dialog enables
          users to search for specific values and select the desired value that should go into the
          LOV field on the base page. The choice list when opened could display various items in the
          following order with separators between each
          (if applicable).
            
<ul>
              
<li>
                an optional Favorites list as specified by the getRecentItems API of ListOfValuesModel.
              </li>
              
<li>
                an optional full list of options as specified by the getItems API of ListOfValuesModel.
              </li>
              
<li>
                a &quot;Search...&quot; option, which when selected opens the &quot;Search and Select&quot; dialog.
                The &quot;Search...&quot; option is not part of the scrollable region of the
                dropdown panel.
              </li>
              
<li>
                followed by any content specified within the customActions facet. Typically one or
                more commandLink components.
              </li>
            </ul>

            
<p></p>
              The list of options (favorites and the full list) are displayed in a tabular format
              inside the drop down panel. The values for every row and column of the table is
              typically stamped using the outputText component.
            
<p></p>
              Note: When the value is selected either from dropdown or from search
              and select dialog, the value gets pushed to the model irrespective of the autoSubmit
              property on the component.

<h2>Data Exchange Mechanism<a name="Data_Exchange_Mechanism"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            Furthermore, just like the inputListOfValues component, the inputComboBoxListOfValues
            components provides a mechanism to facilitate exchange of data between a base page and
            the drop down list and the base page and the &quot;Search and Select&quot; dialog. This is handled
            through the model (or managed bean). Data updates to any fields besides the LOV field,
            on the base page, is acheived through PPR.
          
<p></p>
            Dropdown panel is launched in response to user action on the dropdown button.
            When contentDelivery attribute's value is lazyUncached, LaunchPopupEvent is queued
            while displaying the dropdown panel. When contentDelivery is lazy, LaunchPopupEvent is
            only queued the first time the dropdown panel is being displayed. immediate contentDelivery
            does not queue the LaunchPopupEvent.
          
<p></p>
            When the user selects a row in the drop down panel, the data is returned as a List of
            objects for the selected rows (where each object is the rowData for a selected row).
            Currently the dropdown panel only allows selecting a single row. The List of objects are
            available on the ReturnPopupEvent, that is queued after a selection is made in the
            dropdown panel. Developers need to implement following listener to successfully
            complete the data exchange between the inputComboBoxListOfValues and the dropdown panel.
            
<ul>
              
<li><b>launchPopupListener:</b> Called in response to &quot;LaunchPopupEvent&quot;, this lisener
              can be used to access any data from fields in the base page that is required by the
              the model (or managed bean). The data on the base page is typically used to filter
              the list of data to be shown in the dropdown panel.
            </li>
              
<li><b>returnPopupListener:</b> Called in response to the &quot;ReturnPopupEvent&quot;, this
              listener can be used to retrieve the returned values from ReturnPopupEvent and
              update base fields. The data type of the rowData object is left to the model (or the
              managed bean).
              </li>
            </ul>

            Developers need to implement following three listeners to successfully complete the data
            exchange between the &quot;Search and Select&quot; dialog and the LOV field (and possibly other
            fields) on the base page. The &quot;Search and Select&quot; dialog is launched when choosing the
            &quot;Search...&quot; option in the dropdown panel and a LaunchPopupEvent is queued.
            
<ul>
              
<li><b>launchPopupListener:</b> Called in response to a &quot;LaunchPopupEvent&quot;, this
              listener can be used to access any data, from fields in the base page that is required
              by the model (or managed bean). The data on the base page is typically used
                
<ul>
                  
<li>
                    to determine if the &quot;Search and Select&quot; dialog needs to be launched
                  </li>
                  
<li>
                    to enable fields in the dialog to bind to
                  </li>
                  
<li>
                    to filter the list of data that is shown in the dialog
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              
<li><b>returnPopupDataListener:</b> Called in response to the &quot;ReturnPopupDataEvent&quot;,
              The event is queued when the user selects a value from search and select dialog.

<li><b>returnPopupListener:</b> Called in response to the &quot;ReturnPopupEvent&quot;, this

For all input components (and compound components that have an input component part to which a label can be assigned), the component requires a label. This can be accomplished in one of the following ways (all ways may not be available for all components):

<ul>

<li> a 'label' value on the component</li>

<li> a 'labelAndAccessKey' value on the component</li>

<li> wrapping the component with an af:panelLabelAndMessage component that has a 'label' (or 'labelAndAccessKey') value and a 'for' value specifying the component's id</li>

<li> having a corresponding af:outputLabel component that has a 'value' (or 'valueAndAccessKey') value and a 'for' value specifying the component's id</li>

A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.
