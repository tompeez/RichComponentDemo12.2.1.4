            The poll component delivers PollEvents to the server at fixed intervals.  This can be
            used either for steady updates, or to deliver a heartbeat to keep a user logged in, or
            to warn a user about to be logged out (for some examples).
          
<p></p>
            Polling can be disabled by setting interval attribute to a negative value. <br />
            Polling can be disabled globally at application level when in automation mode based on
            the value of the following property within adf-faces-config element of adf-config.xml.
            The default value is 'on'.

            The same can be achieved using the corresponding System Property <tt>-Dautomation-testing-config.asynchronous-updates=onDemand</tt>

          <b>Note</b>: Any poll event that got queued before polling is disabled (e.g. using setInterval(-1))
            will not be thrown away and will be treated as valid event according to the behavior of polling.

<br />whether a client-side component will be generated.  A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers

<b>Default Value:</b> 600000<br />
<br />If polling is used to update a page, there is a high chance
            that a page will never timeout, since the client keeps sending poll requests
            to the server. However, if we notice user inactivity after a certain amount
            of time we stop polling to give the application a chance to time out.
            By default the framework will use the value which has been configured
            in the web.xml, for the &quot;oracle.adf.view.rich.poll.TIMEOUT&quot; parameter.
            If there is also no value defined in the web.xml, we will use 10 minutes
            as the default value. However we allow page authors to override the value
            that is specified in web.xml on a per page base. The timeout property takes
            the number of milliseconds after which polling will stop, if there was no
            activity by the user, e.g. via keyboard or mouse. If there are multiple 
            poll components on a page we take the maximum of their timeout values. Note that
            polling will restart if user activity is detected again after timeout but before the
            session has expired. If this value is set to -1, the page will never timeout.</td>
