The panelGroupLayout control is a layout element that
arranges its children in one of a few simple patterns.
Each pair of adjacent children will be separated
by an optional separator child.  It can lay out
children consecutively (wrapping as needed), or in a single
horizontal line, or vertically.
         
<p></p>
         <b>Note about stretching layouts and flowing/scrolling layouts:</b>
         
<p></p>
         With today's web browsers, it is not reliable to have vertically-stretched
         content inside of areas that also have scroll bars.
         If you want the outer areas of your page structure to stretch, you need to
         be careful of how you assemble your component tree.
         
<ul>
          
<li>
         First, build up a structure of stretchable components (using panelSplitters
         and panelStretchLayouts).
          </li>
          
<li>
         Second, inside of this structure, create islands of non-stretched content.
         These islands should be rooted with panelGroupLayouts with layout=&quot;scroll&quot;.
         This is an ideal component because it can be stretched and does not stretch
         its children--which likely don't support being stretched anyway.
          </li>
         </ul>
         Rules of thumb:
         
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          
<li>
          Never place a scrolling panelGroupLayout inside of another scrolling
          panelGroupLayout since users do not like nested scroll bars.
          </li>
          
<li>
          Never specify percentage heights in any component's inlineStyle attribute.
          </li>
          
<li>
          Never use the &quot;position&quot; style in any component's inlineStyle attribute.
          </li>
          
<li>
          Unless you are using fixed pixel heights on them, you would never place a
             panelSplitter or panelStretchLayout inside of any panelGroupLayout
             regardless of what you have set its layout attribute to.
          </li>
         </ol>
         If you believe that you need to break one of these rules, this is an
         indication that your page structure is not following the page structure
         guidelines and you will likely have troubles getting your application to
         render consistently across various web browsers and computing platforms.
         
<ul>
          
<li>
         For specific details of about component stretching, please see the
         &quot;geometry management&quot; section in the tag documentation of each component.
          </li>
          
<li>
         See the demo application for real world layout examples that you can use as a
         starting point in your application.  A good starting point is the &quot;Layout
         Basics&quot; page listed under the &quot;Framework Features&quot; tab of the demo
         application.
          </li>
         </ul>
         
<p></p>
You may also alternatively place a facetRef, iterator, or switcher inside of the panelGroupLayout and
their resolved children will be treated as if they were direct children of the panelGroupLayout.
If you don't want this behavior, you may wrap the children you want to be grouped in a group
component.

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

<li>&quot;vertical&quot;: vertically stacked</li>

<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute.

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and
