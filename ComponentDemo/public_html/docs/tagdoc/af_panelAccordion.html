The panelAccordion control can be used to display a set of
          contents belonging to showDetailItem components. Each disclosed showDetailItem is shown as expanded and its contents are
          displayed; if the showDetailItem is not disclosed, only the title bar is displayed.
          Typically you would put one or more showDetailItem components inside of the
          panelAccordion but you may also alternatively place a facetRef, group, iterator,
          or switcher inside of the panelAccordion as long as these wrappers provide
          showDetailItem components as a result of their execution.

<div class="section">
<h2>Disabled showDetailItem Children<a name="Disabled_showDetailItem_Children"></a></h2>
A disabled showDetailItem child does not display any mechanisms to have its disclosed state changed.  However, it can be still be changed programmatically as well as if required to do so when the disclosed state of a sibling showDetailItem changes (depending upon the rules specified in the panelAccordion's discloseMany and discloseNone attributes).

<div class="section">
<h2>Item Flexibility<a name="Item_Flexibility"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>If a showDetailItem has a non-zero flex attribute value assigned to it and if it has only
    one child, that child will be stretched (regardless of discloseMany setting)</li>

<li>The contents of a showDetailItem in a panelAccordion will not be stretched if the flex
    attribute for that showDetailItem is set to zero</li>

<li>If every disclosed showDetailItem has a flex attribute value of zero, the last item (the
    one furthest down) will be stretched as if it had a flex value of 1 (however, if there is
    more than one child in that showDetailItem, the children will not be stretched)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h2>Printable Pages<a name="Printable_Pages"></a></h2>
If you use an &lt;af:showPrintablePageBehavior&gt; within one of
the panes of the accordion, only that pane will be present for
printing when the user activates that behavior.

<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children, e.g. panelStretchLayout if the dimensionsFrom attribute of this panelAccordion is set to &quot;parent&quot;.</li>

<li>This component uses &lt;af:showDetailItem&gt; to organize content into each accordion panel.  The &lt;af:showDetailItem&gt; will allow stretching if:

<ul>

<li>The panelAccordion has dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot;</li>

<li>It contains a single child</li>

<li>It has stretchChildren=&quot;first&quot; specified</li>

<li>The child has no width, height, margin, border, and padding</li>

<li>The child must be capable of being stretched</li>
</ul>
Examples of components that can be stretched inside of a &lt;af:showDetailItem&gt; include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:decorativeBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelAccordion&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelCollection&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelHeader&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelSplitter&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelStretchLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelTabbed&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:region&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:table&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:tree&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:treeTable&gt;</li>
</ul>
If you try to put a component inside of this component and that child component does not support being stretched, then the component hierarchy is illegal.
To make it legal, you need to insert another intermediate component between this component and the child component.
This intermediate component must support being stretched and must not stretch its children.
An example of such a component that is commonly used for this purpose is &lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;.
By using a wrapper like this, you create a flowing layout area where nothing will be stretched inside of it.
Examples of components that do not support being stretched inside of these panelStretchLayout facets (and therefore need to be wrapped) include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:panelBorderLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelFormLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;default&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelLabelAndMessage&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelList&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;trh:tableLayout&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
There are other ways in which you can control the geometry of this component when it is not being stretched by its ancestor:

<ul>

<li>You can specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;children&quot; for the panelAccordion to be as tall as the currently-disclosed af:showDetailItem children.  When using this &quot;children&quot; setting, the stretchChildren, flex, and inflexibleHeight attributes on af:showDetailItem and any height assignment (e.g. inlineStyle or styleClass) on the panelAccordion must be omitted or else there would be a competing assignment for how tall the component will be.</li>

<li>You can also specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot; to make the panelAccordion get its dimensions from the inlineStyle and if not provided from there then from its parent component or if not provided from the parent then from the skin (stretchChildren, flex, inflexibleHeight on af:showDetailItem will be honored).</li>

<li>Using dimensionsFrom=&quot;auto&quot; will choose either &quot;children&quot; or &quot;parent&quot; depending on whether the panelAccordion is being stretched by its parent.</li>
</ul>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and
