            A toolbar is a single row container designed to hold buttons and other simple components.
            Toolbars are not rendered on printable pages.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Allowed Children<a name="Allowed_Children"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            While a toolbar was designed to hold buttons, it can also contain other simple 
            components. But you should be aware that this could cause undesirable changes to its 
            visual appearance. For example, if you include a tall component, the toolbar will be 
            taller to compensate, and other items on the toolbar may no longer align nicely. If you 
            include an overly wide component, it may look weird when that component is forced into 
            overflow. A toolbar can also dynamically add children using a facetRef, iterator, or 
            switcher child.
          
<p></p>
            Please note that you should not nest toolbars, menuBars, or other container-type 
            components inside a toolbar. This is incompatible with overflow and is not supported. If 
            you would like to display multiple toolbars or menuBars in a single row, you should 
            instead use a toolbox group.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Grouping Items in a Toolbar<a name="Grouping_Items_in_a_Toolbar"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            If you use an <tt>&lt;af:group&gt;</tt> to group items inside a toolbar, the toolbar 
            will by default include separators around the group. You should also note that the group 
            has an effect on certain items. For example, buttons with type of radio that are grouped 
            together are automatically considered part of the same radio group.
          
<p></p>
            By default visual group separators always appear. If you want a group but do not want 
            the group separator to appear, you can set the group's startBoundary or endBoundary 
            attributes to 'hide' to request that the corresponding boundary be hidden. Note that 
            when a first group's endBoundary and a second group's startBoundary are both set, the 
            separator will only be hidden if both values are set to 'hide' or one value is 'hide'
            while the other value is 'dontCare'.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Toolbar Layout<a name="Toolbar_Layout"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            Toolbars were designed to be used inside an <tt>&lt;af:toolbox&gt;</tt>. A toolbox 
            allows highly customizable display of toolbars, by utilizing their flex values and 
            allowing multiple toolbars and menuBars per row. 
          
<p></p>
            You may use a toolbar outside of a toolbox, though doing so will cause the toolbar to 
            lose the geometry management functionality that the toolbox provides. Without a toolbox, 
            you cannot have multiple toolbars per row or benefit from flex values.
          
<p></p>
            Because toolbars and toolboxes are overflow components, they do not have a set width 
            size. A toolbar or toolbox should be placed in a section of the page where it can 
            horizontally stretch to the available size for proper rendering. Putting a toolbar or 
            toolbox inside a section of the page where it is horizontally constrained to a minimum 
            size (like a panelStretchLayout end facet) will be error-prone, due to the fact that the 
            width of the toolbar varies with its current overflow state.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Keyboard Access<a name="Keyboard_Access"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            Toolbars are designed to use arrow keys to move focus between toolbar items. When buttons
            and other simple widgets are included on a toolbar, they are no longer individual tabstops.
            Instead, the toolbar is a single tabstop with the left and right arrow keys being used to 
            access the items on the toolbar. When arrowing beyond the last (or first) toolbar item, 
            the focus is moved to the next (or previous) tab stop outside the toolbar. For items in 
            overflow, the up and down arrow keys also work to move focus.
          
<p></p>
            Some widgets (especially input components) are already using arrow keys for other purposes.
            For example, inputText uses arrow keys to move cursor inside the input. That makes these
            components incompatible with the default keyboard paradigm described above. If a toolbar
            detects that it has children like this, or contains content that it does not recognize, 
            then all children will remain as default tabstops so they can still be accessed by a 
            keyboard only user. Even though we handle this situation, it is less than ideal. 
          
<p></p>
            Components that are already responding to arrow keys should either not be placed on a toolbar 
            or be placed on a toolbar by themselves.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Right Justifying Toolbar Items<a name="Right_Justifying_Toolbar_Items"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            By default toolbars are left (start side) justified. In order to make some or all of the 
            toolbar items right (end side) justified, you can use the stretchId attibute. StretchId 
            is usually set to the id of an af:spacer on the toolbar that you want to stretch to take 
            up any available extra horizontal space. The component that you specify must be present 
            on the client. Therefore, if using a component that may not be present on the client 
            (like af:spacer), you should set the child component's clientComponent attribute to 
            'true'.

<h2>Assigning Percent Width to a Toolbar in a Row<a name="Assigning_Percent_Width_to_a_Toolbar_in_a_Row"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            When used inside a toolbox row, you can use a flex value on a toolbar to control what 
            percentage of the available horizontal space that toolbar should receive. For example, 
            if your toolbox row has 3 toolbars, each with a flex value of &quot;1&quot;, then they receive 
            their flex value (1) of the total space available (3). This means that each of the three 
            toolbars would be given one third of the available horizontal space. 
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Updating through PartialTriggers<a name="Updating_through_PartialTriggers"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            Note that if a toolbar child component is going to be updated through partial page 
            rendering, you need to update the toolbar as well. You do this by adding the child 
            components id to the toolbar's partialTriggers attribute. This way the toolbar can 
            appropriately manage its children in respect to sizing and placement in overflow. Also 
            note that many input components also update themselves through partial page rendering. 
            If you include an input component (or quickQuery) on a toolbar, you should include that 
            child's id in the toolbar's partialTriggers attribute so that the toolbar also updates 
            when the input component is replaced. Because this partialTrigger will cause overflow to
            close during the toolbar ppr, toolbar child components that update themselves via ppr 
            outside of a submit (like InputComboboxLOV) will work better when not in overflow.

<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>
            
<ul>
              
<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches 
                its children, e.g. panelStretchLayout, panelSplitter.</li>
              
<li>This component accepts buttons and other simple components as children, 
                including spacers and images. Children are not by default stretched. This component 
                also has a stretchId attribute. When this attribute is set to the id of one of its 
                children, that child is stretched.</li>
            </ul>
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Overflow<a name="Overflow"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>Toolbar is an overflow component. When a toolbar does not have enough space to 
            display all items, the children are put into overflow and an overflow button is 
            displayed. When a toolbar in a toolbox row has a flex value, the flex value is strictly 
            followed, even in regards to overflow. When toolbars (or menuBars) in a toolbox row do 
            not have flex values, then the right most (end side) toolbar would be forced into 
            overflow before left side toolbars. Spacer and image children on toolbars are not put 
            into overflow.
          
<p></p>Overflow components must be part of a supported layout in order to work 
                  properly on the page.
          
<p></p>An overflow component requires that it is either:
          
<ul>
          
<li>in a container that stretches its children, or</li>
          
<li>in a container that has a set width.</li>
          </ul>
          
<p></p>Under these circumstances, when the overflow component is larger than the parent container, 
                  the overflow component will display an overflow button. Selecting the overflow button will 
                  show a popup containing the items that didn't fit on the page.
          
<p></p>Setting up an overflow component with the following layouts is not supported. If you use one 
                  of these layouts, you may have unexpected and inconsistent results:
          
<ul>
          
<li>in a container that does not stretch its children.</li>
          
<li>in a container that displays multiple children horizontally without explicit sizes 
                   for each child. For example, a panelGroupLayout with layout='horizontal' would be 
                   invalid, but panelSplitter is OK because it has an explicitly set splitter position.</li>
          
<li>setting the overflow component with a styleClass or inlineStyle that assigns a 
                   percentage width value. Note that this includes assigning 
                   styleClass='AFStretchWidth' on an overflow component.</li>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary.

        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of
        two naming containers (including itself if the component is a naming container)
        and begin the search from there, etc.</td>

<tr class="b">

<td>rendered</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />whether the component is rendered. When set to false, no output will be
		delivered for this component (the component will not in any way be rendered,
		and cannot be made visible on the client). If you want to change a component's
		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the
                parent refreshes and in turn will render this component.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>shortDesc</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

<tr class="b">

<td>stretchId</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the id of a child component that will be given all of the available space left in 
        the toolbar if the contents of the toolbar do not use all of the space that the toolbar has 
        available. The component that you specify must be present on the client. Therefore, if using 
        a component that may not be present on the client (like af:spacer), you should set the child 
        component's clientComponent attribute to 'true'.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>styleClass</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can
                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you
                     can use one of our public style classes, like 'AFInstructionText'.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>unsecure</td>
<td>java.util.Set</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>visible</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
