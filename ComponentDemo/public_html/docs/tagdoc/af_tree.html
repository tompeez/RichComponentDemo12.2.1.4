          The Tree is used to display data that is structured in a hierarchical format.
          This component supports multiple root elements, and it has a
          simple user interface (UI) - each element in the Tree is appropriately indented to indicate
          its level in the hierarchy, and is connected to its parent.
          The features of the Tree component include mechanisms for expanding and
          collapsing portions of the hierarchy.
        
<p></p>
          The &quot;nodeStamp&quot; facet of the Tree is used to display the
          data for each element in the tree. The &quot;nodeStamp&quot; is repeatedly
          rendered (stamped) once per element. The &quot;nodeStamp&quot; can contain
          images and text items. The selection is displayed only around the text items.
   
<p></p>Because of this stamping behavior, some components may not work inside the tree. Most components will
      work without problems, for example any input and output components. If you need to use multiple components
      inside a cell, you can wrap them inside a panelGroupLayout component. Components that themselves support
      stamping are not supported, such as trees within a tree or region within a tree.
   
<div class="section">
<h2>Hierarchical Selector<a name="Hierarchical_Selector"></a></h2>
   
<p></p>
      The tree and treeTable components support a focusRowKey attribute that can be set (through a backing
      bean or EL expression) to point to a row key for a node inside the tree (at any level).
   
<p></p>
      The focusRowKey attribute is also set by the tree renderer when the user right clicks on a node and
      selects the &quot;Show as top&quot; context menu item (or the &quot;Show as top&quot; toolbar button/menu in panelCollection).
   
<p></p>
      When the focusRowKey attribute is set, the Tree renders the node pointed to by the focusRowKey attribute
      as the root node in the Tree and displays a &quot;Hierarchical Selector&quot; icon next to the root node.
      Clicking the Hierarchical Selector icon, displays a Hierarchical Selector popup which shows the path to
      the focusRowKey from the root node of the Tree.
   
<p></p>
      The pathStamp facet determines how the content of the Hierarchical Selector popup is rendered, just like
      the nodeStamp facet determines how the content of the tree is rendered. For example, including an af:image
      and an af:outputText in the pathStamp facet causes the tree to render an image and an outputText component
      for each node level in the Hierarchical Selector popup.

<b>Default Value:</b> false<br />

<td>inlineStyle</td>

<td>
the CSS styles to use for this component. This
is intended for basic style changes. The inlineStyle is a set of CSS styles
that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

<b>Default Value:</b> 50<br />
<br />The nonScrollableRows property determines the number of

      where table scrolling is unavailable. This property will not have
      an affect outside of these circumstances.</td>

the IDs of the components that should trigger a partial update.
        This component will listen on the trigger components. If one of the
        trigger components receives an event that will cause it to update
        in some way, this component will request to be updated too.
        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of
        two naming containers (including itself if the component is a naming container)
        and begin the search from there, etc.</td>

		and cannot be made visible on the client). If you want to change a component's
		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the

<br />whether or not it is enabled to delay row selection event for 300ms when a user navigates rows with arrow up/down key. 
              When it is enabled, it can improve the performance by avoiding sending many events to server while a user keeps arrow up/down
              key down to navigate.

the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you

A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that

<html>
          Name of the EL variable used to reference the varStatus information.
          Once this component has completed rendering, this variable is
          removed (or reverted back to its previous value).
          The VarStatus provides contextual information about the state of the
          component to EL expressions. For components that iterate, varStatus
          also provides loop counter information.  Please see the this 
          component's documentation for the specific properties on the varStatus.
          The common properties on varStatus include:
          
<ul>
          
<li>&quot;model&quot; - returns the CollectionModel for this component</li>
          
<li>&quot;index&quot; - returns the zero based row index</li>
          
<li>&quot;hierarchicalIndex&quot; - returns an array containing the row indices of heirarchy of the currrent row, for e.g. [0,1,2]
              Please use this attribute with caution since it requires moving currency to calculate the row index for 
              each parent collection in the tree hierarchy.
          </li>
          
<li>&quot;hierarchicalLabel&quot; - returns a string label representing the hierarchy of that row, for e.g. 1.1, 1.1.1. 
             It should be noted that the labels are 1 based vs 0 based for rowIndex. 
            Please use this attribute with caution since it requires moving currency to calculate the row index for 
              each parent collection in the tree hierarchy.

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
