<p></p>          
  The panelFormLayout positions input form controls, such that their labels and fields line up 
  vertically.  It supports multiple columns, and also supports a footer facet.

<p></p>
  Usually, this component will simply contain labelled ADF Faces input components in its main 
  content. This includes components whose names start with 'input' (like inputText and inputDate) 
  and components that start with 'select' (like selectOneChoice, selectBooleanRadio, and 
  selectManyChoice). These components must have their 'simple' attribute set to false, which is the 
  default, and will cause the labels and fields inside the panelFormLayout to be aligned vertically.

<p></p>
  When more complex field content is needed, use a panelLabelAndMessage around the content.

<p></p>
  Other components can be added to panelFormLayout, but they will not line up with labels and fields 
  automatically, and each will appear on its own row. You can use other panel components, like 
  a horizontal layout panelGroupLayout, to layout a row of buttons or fields. To align content with other
  labels and fields, use panelLabelAndMessage or use the 'footer' facet.  You may also alternatively place
  a facetRef, iterator, or switcher inside of the panelFormLayout and their resolved children will be treated
  as if they were direct children of the panelFormLayout.

<div class="section">
<h2>Grouping Items in a PanelFormLayout<a name="Grouping_Items_in_a_PanelFormLayout"></a></h2>

<p></p>
  PanelFormLayout supports grouping of its child components. If you place panelFormLayout children 
  inside of a group, by default separators will be drawn around the group of items if adjacent to 
  other form items. By default separators won't be drawn at the top if the group is the first item 
  in the column or, at the bottom if the group is the last item in the column. Grouped 
  panelFormLayout items are kept in the same column of the panelFormLayout even when the assigned 
  rows attribute is set to a value smaller than the number of items in the group. The 
  panelFormLayout component also supports the group component in its footer facet so you can place 
  more than one item in the footer.  You can group footer items one additional time to get 
  separators to appear.
  In responsive layout mode, nesting of groups isn't supported.

<p></p>
  By default visual group separators always appear (following the rules above). If you want a group 
  but do not want the group separator to appear, you can set the group's startBoundary or 
  endBoundary attributes to 'hide' to request that the corresponding boundary be hidden. Note that 
  when a first group's endBoundary and a second group's startBoundary are both set, the separator 
  will only be hidden if both values are set to 'hide' or one value is 'hide' while the other value 
  is 'dontCare'.

<p></p>
  A group of items can also have a title, by setting the group's title attribute. Only groups that
  have their start boundaries displayed will show their title values. Note that you should use a 
  group title that is not horizontally longer than the width of the current panelFormLayout column. 
  If you choose a group title that is longer than the width of the panelFormLayout, the 
  panelFormLayout will stretch horizontally to accommodate the title.

This facet may not always line up perfectly, particularly if the labels or fields used in the panelFormLayout are longer than what you have allocated for them.  Adjust the allocations you have with the labelWidth and fieldWidth attributes when necessary.  Remember that labelWidth and fieldWidth must use the same units.  Also, the columns attribute on inputText may be helpful to reduce the amount of space that it consumes.
In responsive layout mode, the extra wide fields will stretch and end align with the widest field in the second column if there are three or more columns being displayed. Else the extra wide fields will end align with widest field in the last column being displayed.

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

If a fieldWidth is provided as a percentage the labelWidth and the fieldWidth should total up to 100% (regardless of the number of columns).  If the fieldWidth is not specified, the browser will let the children components have a natural flowing layout which may mean that the footer facet contents do not line up with the main form items.  However, if the fieldWidth is not specified but a labelWidth is specified as a percentage, the fieldWidth will be derived as the appropriate percentage value for you.  Note that if you are using a percentage value, multiple columns, and a footer, you may see a slight offset between the positioning of the main form items and the footer items in some web browsers if that browser does not honor fractional divisions of percentages.  To minimize this effect, it is recommended that a percentage labelWidth be evenly divisible by the number of columns.

            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute.

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>
