The showDetail provides a means of toggling a group of components between being
disclosed or undisclosed.  A showDetail should be used to:

<ul>
  
<li>
    hide/show an entire section or a part of a section of information within the
    contents of a page such as:
    
<ul>
      
<li>show more information / hide more information</li>
      
<li>show details / hide details</li>
      
<li>
        show &quot;section name&quot; / hide &quot;section name&quot;
      </li>
      
<li>show graph/hide graph, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
<li>hide/show functionality such as:
    
<ul>
       
<li>simple/advance search</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
<li>hide/show details of a table row</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
  On mobile devices the showDetail renders nothing itself, but does renders its
  children.

<div class="section">
<h2>Appearance<a name="Appearance"></a></h2>
  The appearance of the showDetail is dependent upon the disclosed, disclosedText, and
  undisclosedText properties, as well as the presence of a prompt facet.
  
<ul>
    
<li>
      If the &quot;disclosed&quot; property is set to false, the showDetail is considered closed. An
      open &quot;+&quot; icon will be rendered next to the undisclosedText and the showDetail children
      will not be shown.
    </li>
    
<li>
      If the &quot;disclosed&quot; property is set to true, the showDetail is considered opened. A
      close &quot;-&quot; icon will be rendered next to the disclosedText and the showDetail children
      will be shown.
    </li>
  </ul>
  If you do not specify a &quot;disclosedText&quot; property for the component, the text
  &quot;Hide&quot; will be used instead. If you do not specify an &quot;undisclosedText&quot;
  property for the component, the text &quot;Show&quot; will be used instead. Alternatively, you can
  specify your own prompt by using the &quot;prompt&quot; facet.

<div class="section">
<h2>Events<a name="Events"></a></h2>
  Clicking on the icon of the showDetail will deliver a <tt>DisclosureEvent</tt>
  to the server.  If a &quot;prompt&quot; facet is used, changing the value of the
  disclosed attribute on this component will also deliver the event.

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component),

<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>

the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different

<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set

                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that

      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
