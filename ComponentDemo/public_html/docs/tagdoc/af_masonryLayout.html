The masonry layout component is a container that shows its children in a grid like a dashboard. 
        
<p></p>
        <b>Child sizing:</b>
        
<p></p>
        Each direct child component must have a size style class applied to it that specifies the
        pixel size of that child and indicates how many columns and rows that child spans in
        the grid.  The size style classes are named using the pattern 
        'AFMasonryTileSizeCxR', where C and R are numbers indicating the column and row spans of that 
        child in the grid.  The width and height attributes defined by the style class specify the 
        pixel sizes corresponding to the grid spans.  For example, 'AFMasonryTileSize2x1' indicates 
        that a tile spans two columns and one row in the grid.  The component provides predefined 
        size style classes for spans from 1x1 up to and including 3x2 and 2x3.  
        
<p></p>
        An application may define additional size style classes for spans up to and including 
        10x10 through skinning.  The style class names must follow the pattern described above.  
        
<p></p>
        <b>Note about stretching layouts and flowing/scrolling layouts:</b>
        
<p></p>
        With today's web browsers, it is not reliable to have vertically-stretched
        content inside of areas that also have scroll bars.
        If you want the outer areas of your page structure to stretch, you need to
        be careful of how you assemble your component tree.
        
<ul>
        
<li>
        First, build up a structure of stretchable components (using panelSplitters
        or panelGridLayouts).
        </li>
        
<li>
        Second, inside of this structure, create islands of non-stretched content.
        </li>
        </ul>
        Rules of thumb:
        
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        
<li>
        Never nest one scrolling container inside of another scrolling
        container since users do not like nested scroll bars.
        </li>
        
<li>
        Never specify percentage heights in any component's inlineStyle attribute.
        </li>
        
<li>
        Never use the &quot;position&quot; style in any component's inlineStyle attribute.
        </li>
        </ol>
        If you believe that you need to break one of these rules, this is an
        indication that your page structure is not following the page structure
        guidelines and you will likely have troubles getting your application to
        render consistently across various web browsers and computing platforms.
        
<ul>
        
<li>
        For specific details about component stretching, please see the
        &quot;geometry management&quot; section in the tag documentation of each component.
        </li>
        
<li>
        See the demo application for real world layout examples that you can use as a
        starting point in your application.  A good starting point is the &quot;Layout
        Basics&quot; page listed under the &quot;Framework Features&quot; tab of the demo
        application.
        </li>
        </ul>

<br />whether a client-side component will be generated.  A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component),

        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,

                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that
