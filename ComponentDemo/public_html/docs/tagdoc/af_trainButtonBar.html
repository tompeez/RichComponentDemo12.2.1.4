The trainButtonBar component includes two buttons that provide an additional means to 
          navigate a multi-step process. The train component can also be used to navigate a 
          multi-step process. TrainButtonBars are not rendered on printable pages.
          
<p></p>
          The trainButtonBar by default, provides a 'Back' and a 'Next' buttons, that move back and
          forth in a multi-step process and in an order as dictated by the underlying model 
          implmentation. 
            
<ul>
              
<li>         
                The &quot;Back&quot; button takes the user from the current active stop to the previously 
                visited and enabled stop (as provided by the model). If none of previous stops are 
                enabled or the current stop happens to be the first stop, the &quot;back&quot; button will 
                appear disabled. The label for the Back button is defined in the ResourceBundle 
                under the property key &quot;af_trainButtonBar.BACK&quot;.
              </li>
              
<li>    
                The &quot;Next&quot; button takes the user to the next stop in the sequence (as provided by the 
                model). If the next stop is disabled or the current stop happens to be the last stop, 
                the &quot;Next&quot; button will appear disabled. When the Next button appears disabled when the 
                current stop is not the last stop, it is the responsibility of the model to ensure 
                that it is enabled at some point (for e.g., after a condition is met) to facilitate 
                forward navigation through the process. The label for the Next button is defined in 
                the ResourceBundle under the property key &quot;af_trainButtonBar.NEXT&quot;.
              </li>
            </ul>
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Model<a name="Model"></a></h2>          
          
<p></p>
            The trainButtonBar takes a model of type 
            <tt>org.apache.myfaces.adf.model.MenuModel</tt>. The last node along the 
            focusPath is usually the current active stop and its previous and next nodes at the same 
            level are rendered as buttons &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Next&quot; respectively. 
            The default MenuModel implementation knows how to go from the current viewId to the 
            focusRowKey. Notice that the MenuModel has no special knowledge of page navigation and 
            places no requirements on the nodes that go into the tree. The last node along with its
            sibling, in the tree are stamped out using the &quot;nodeStamp&quot; facet, which should contain a 
            commandNavigationItem component. This allows the default actionListener mechanism to be 
            used for page navigation. 
          
<p></p>
            <b>Note</b>: When using Facelets as the page declaration language (PDL), the 'nodestamp' 
            facet, if explicitly specified, should contain only one commandNavigationItem. Multiple 
            components are not supported by this facet.
          
<p></p>
            For more information about train behaviors please refer to the tag documentation for the 
            train component.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Simplified trainButtonBar Tag Usage<a name="Simplified_trainButtonBar_Tag_Usage"></a></h2>          
          
<p></p>
            The tag usage for the trainButtonBar component has been simplified. This tag can be used
            in the simple case as below:
            <br />
            <tt>&lt;af:trainButtonBar value=&quot;#{my_bean.menuModel}&quot;/&gt;</tt>
            <br />
            The benefits of using the simple tag are:
            
<ul>
              
<li>
                Simpler and smaller jspx pages. There is no need to specify the nodestamp 
                facet (that includes a commandNavigationItem) in every page that contains a 
                trainButtonBar.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Not specifying the nodeStamp facet means that the commandNavigationItem component
                (that is used to render the button states) is now created implicitly. Also, EL 
                expressions are bound to the relevant properties of the component 
                automatically.
              </li>
              
<li>
                The properties of commandNavigationItem that are EL bound are - action, 
                disabled, immediate, messageType, shortDesc, showRequired, textAndAccessKey and 
                visited.
              </li>
              
<li>
                The only requirement for using the simplified train tag is that customers need 
                to ensure that the object representing a train stop, resemble (contain the same 
                methods as) <tt>oracle.adf.view.rich.model.TrainStopModel</tt>. IOW, the 
                object returned from the call to CollectionModel.getRowData(int), should be an 
                object resembling TrainStopModel or be a subclass of TrainStopModel.
              </li>
              
<li>
                NOTE: Customers can still use the full-blown tag definition for trainButtonBar, 
                depending on the specific use-cases.

<br />whether a client-side component will be generated.  A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and
