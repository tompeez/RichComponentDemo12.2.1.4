<p></p>panelDashboard features:
            
<ul>
              
<li>Arranges panelBox (or region with showHeader=always) components into a tiled layout of columns and rows.  You can specify the number of columns as well as a CSS length value for the height of the rows.</li>
              
<li>Stretches the panelBox children to fit within the width of a column and the specified row height.</li>
              
<li>If all of the child panelBoxes cannot fit within the dimensions of the panelDashboard (e.g. due to the specified number of columns and row height), then the panelDashboard will provide a scroll bar so that the user can access the panelBox children that might not be initially viewable.</li>
              
<li>Supports being stretched so that you can place the panelDashboard inside of a panelSplitter.</li>
              
<li>Provides a dropListener attribute so that you can modify your component tree in response to a reorder gesture performed by the user because of componentDragSource tags inside of the panelBox children.</li>
              
<li>Provides methods on the RichPanelDashboard component class that you can use to perform an optimized render of the panelDashboard when you make &quot;insert&quot; or &quot;detete&quot; changes to its children (e.g. changing the rendered flag on a specific child) without requiring that the entire dashboard be redrawn:
                
<ul>
                  
<li>prepareOptimizedEncodingOfInsertedChild()</li>
                  
<li>prepareOptimizedEncodingOfDeletedChild()</li>
                </ul></li>
              
<li>Also, to help make your application feel more responsive to the user, an optional panelDashboardBehavior tag can be used on command components that perform optimized inserts into the dashboard.  This tag will cause the dashboard to open up a new location for the child that you are about to insert.  The benefit is that this opening up of space happens before your action event is sent to the server so the user will see immediate feedback while your action listener is busy modifying the component tree and preparing the dashboard for the optimized encoding of the insert.  If you decide not to use this tag, there will be a slight delay while your action listener is processing before the use sees any change to the dashboard structure.</li>
              
<li>The af:panelDashboard tag accepts af:dataFlavor tags as children.  You will want to use a data flavor if you want your dashboard's dropListener to handle component drag sources from elsewhere on the page (e.g. from a side bar near the dashboard) instead of only for the direct children of the dashboard.  If this side bar represents a menu listing of possible dashboard children that the user can see, you may expose the non-rendered dashboard children as component drag sources in this list.  If you do this, a user can then drag from the side bar and drop it into the dashboard at a precise desired drop location among the rendered dashboard children.  Your dropListener that you have assigned to the dashboard component can then listen for this gesture, set the requested dashboard child to now be rendered, set its location to be the requested drop position, and perform an optimized render so that only the content for that child is sent to the browser which in turn, gets revealed to the user.</li>
            </ul>


<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children. e.g. panelStretchLayout or panelSplitter if the dimensionsFrom attribute of this panelDashboard is set to &quot;parent&quot;.</li>

<li>This component organizes its children components into a grid based on the number of columns and the rowHeight.  The child components that can be stretched inside of the panelDashboard include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:panelBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:region&gt;</li>
</ul>
If you try to put any other component inside of this component (except for af:dataFlavor which can be used to allow discriminants of external drops), then the component hierarchy is illegal.
</li>
</ul>
There are other ways in which you can control the geometry of this component when it is not being stretched by its ancestor:

<ul>

<li>You can specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;children&quot; for the panelDashboard to be as tall as the number of visible rows multiplied by the rowHeight setting.  When using this &quot;children&quot; setting, the topHeight attribute will still be honored (unless percent units are specified) but any height assignment (e.g. inlineStyle or styleClass) on the panelDashboard must be omitted or else there would be a competing assignment for how tall the component will be.</li>

<li>You can also specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot; to make the panelDashboard get its dimensions from the inlineStyle and if not provided from there then from its parent component or if not provided from the parent then from the skin.</li>

<li>Using dimensionsFrom=&quot;auto&quot; will choose either &quot;children&quot; or &quot;parent&quot; depending on whether the panelDashboard is being stretched by its parent.</li>
</ul>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

<td>
A method reference to a callback with the signature oracle.adf.view.rich.dnd.DnDAction method(oracle.adf.view.rich.event.DropEvent dropEvent) called when a drop occurs on the component. Since the
panelDashboard will automatically adjust the positions of its children in the browser, this method should return
DnDAction.NONE if your handler is successful in adjusting the position of the reordered children since this will
cause the panelDashboard to be left as is.   If you return DnDAction.MOVE, the panelDashboard will be redrawn.
You may wish to use org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.change.ReorderChildrenComponentChange and ChangeManager().addComponentChange() if you wish to preserve a new ordering of the children.  Ideally, you should use an MDS ChangeManager to persist the change longer than the user's session so that the use does not have to repeatedly make the same reorder gesture every time your application is used.  The dropEvent.getDropSiteIndex() method will give you the location that the user desires the dragged component to end up at.  Use dropEvent.getTransferable().getData(DataFlavor.UICOMPONENT_FLAVOR)
to get the dragged component.</td>

<li>Subsequent characters must be letters (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method), digits as defined by the Character.isDigit() method, 
dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers

that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,

the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set

                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that
