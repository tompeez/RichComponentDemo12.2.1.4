<p></p>A note window is a layer that contains read-only information associated with a particular
     UI component. Note windows are used to display help and messages. Note windows are commonly shown on mouse over
     or on focus. Note windows are always attached to their associated component and cannot be manually repositioned.  The
     <tt>af:noteWindow</tt> must be used with the <tt>af:popup</tt> component and is required to be the
     immediate child of the <tt>af:popup</tt>.  Only a single child occurrence is supported by
     the <tt>af:popup</tt>.  The note window is shown using the <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt>
     tag or programmatically using the client and server popup APIs.
     
     
<p></p>The default auto-dismissal behavior of a <tt>af:noteWindow</tt> is like that of the <tt>af:menu</tt> but is 
        also influenced by the trigger type (mouseHover) when using the <tt>af:showPopupBehavior</tt> tag.  If focus leaves 
        from the content of the popup or from the launching source, it's automatically canceled.  The default auto-dismissal 
        behavior can be overridden  using the <tt>autoDismissalTimeout</tt> property of the noteWindow.  A common usecase for using
        this property is when a noteWindow is used to communicate general information that is not associated directly with 
        the state of an input component but still aligned to some status indicator within the page.


<div class="section">
<h2>Printable Pages<a name="Printable_Pages"></a></h2>
  Inline popups define content in the page that is hidden by default but when shown is layered above the
  primary document.  Inline popups are not print friendly meaning that their content is excluded 
  from printiable pages similar to navigation components.  This also applies to uses of the
  &lt;af:showPrintablePageBehavior&gt; tag within the content of the af:noteWindow.


<div class="section">
<h2>Layout Considerations<a name="Layout_Considerations"></a></h2>
  
<p></p>The noteWindows dimensions are determined by the size of its content. There is no overflow in the content area.  This means 
  that the content area of the noteWindow will not be scrollable or have the ability to clip its content.

  The default behavior for the noteWindow is ideal for displaying read-only content but there are some caveats to watch for.
  
<ul>
    
<li>The noteWindow will size to content. If the content is also stretching to the size of the of the parent popup 
        container, this combination results in an invalid layout that is inconsistently rendered across browsers. 
        The workaround for this issue is to add fixed dimensions to the root child content layout component that provides 
        scrolling or stretching (af:panelGroupLayout layout=scroll or af:panelStretchLayout).</li>
    
<li>The content container of the noteWindow doesn't have having overflow or the ability to stretch its children.  This must
        be handled using the appropriate layout component within its content.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component cannot be stretched by a parent layout component and cannot be assigned dimensions via the inlineStyle or styleClass because it displays on its own layer in the page and gets its dimensions from its children's dimensions.</li>

<li>This component does not stretch its children.</li>

            The popup will dismiss after shown for the period of seconds provided by the property.  The timeout 
            period is revoked if the user moves the mouse over the content of the note window popup.  The act of

            note window, which will dismiss when focus changes from the launching source or from the content

A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant

        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component),
