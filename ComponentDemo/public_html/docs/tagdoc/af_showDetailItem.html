  The showDetailItem component is used inside of a panelAccordion, panelTabbed or panelDrawer 
  component to contain a group of children.  It is identified visually by the the text and/or icon 
  attribute values and lays out its children.  Note the difference between &quot;disclosed&quot; and
  &quot;rendered&quot;: if &quot;rendered&quot; is false, it means that this the accordion header 
  bar or tab link and its corresponding contents are not available at all to the user, whereas if
  &quot;disclosed&quot; is false, it means that the contents of the item are not currently visible, 
  but may be made visible by the user since the accordion header bar or tab link are still visible.
  
  
<p></p>
    The lifecycle (including validation) is not run for any components in a showDetailItem which is not disclosed.
    The lifecycle is only run on the showDetailItem(s) which is disclosed.


<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component should never have any width or height specified in its inlineStyle because it will always gets its dimensions from its ancestor component.</li>

<li>This component cannot be used by itself, refer to the &lt;af:panelAccordion&gt;, &lt;af:panelTabbed&gt; and &lt;af:panelDrawer&gt; tag documentation for more details about geometry management.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h2>Disclosure Events<a name="Disclosure_Events"></a></h2>

<p></p>
The af:showDetailItem component inside of af:panelAccordion and af:panelTabbed supports queuing of disclosure events so that validation can properly be handled--both on the server and on the client.


<p></p>
If you have an af:panelTabbed or an af:panelAccordion (with discloseMany=&quot;false&quot; and discloseNone=&quot;false&quot;):


<ul>

<li>On client:

<ul>

<li>showDetailItem 1 is showing but not showDetailItem 2</li>

<li>user clicks to disclose item 2</li>

<li>a client-only disclosure event gets kicked off to set disclosed to false for item 1</li>

<li>if this first event is not canceled, another client disclosure event gets kicked off to set disclosed to true for item 2</li>

<li>if this second event is not canceled, it gets sent to the server</li>

<li>otherwise, no more disclosure changes</li>
</ul></li>

<li>On server:

<ul>

<li>the server disclosure event is kicked off to set disclosed to true on item 2</li>

<li>if this first server event is not canceled, another server disclosure event gets kicked off to set disclosed to false for item 1</li>

<li>if neither server event is canceled, the new states get rendered and the user will see the newly disclosed states on the client</li>

<li>otherwise, the client looks the same as it was before</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p></p>
For af:panelAccordion with discloseMany=&quot;false&quot; and discloseNone=&quot;true&quot;, the process is the same as above only when the disclosure change forces a paired change (when 2 disclosed states are involved). If only one disclosure change is involved, there will just be 1 client and 1 server disclosure event.


<p></p>
For af:panelAccordion with discloseMany=&quot;true&quot; (and any discloseNone setting), only one disclosure change is involved; there will just be 1 client and 1 server disclosure event.


<div class="section">
<h2>Item Events<a name="Item_Events"></a></h2>

<p></p>
The af:showDetailItem component inside of af:panelTabbed supports removal of tabs. When the user removes a tab, an item event is generated with the item type of &quot;removal&quot;. On the client, an <tt>AdfItemEvent</tt> is generated and the method <tt>getItemAction()</tt> will return a value of <tt>AdfItemEvent.ITEM_ACTION_REMOVE</tt> on tab removal. Should the client event not be canceled, the event will propagate to the server where a <tt>oracle.adf.view.rich.event.ItemEvent</tt> will be queued and broadcast. The <tt>getType()</tt> method may be used to retrieve the event type (removal) on the server.

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

<tr class="b">

<td>inlineStyle</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the CSS styles to use for this component. This
is intended for basic style changes. The inlineStyle is a set of CSS styles
that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>itemListener</td>
<td>javax.el.MethodExpression</td>
<td>Only EL</td>
<td>
a method reference to an item listener</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>partialTriggers</td>
<td>String[]</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the IDs of the components that should trigger a partial update.
        This component will listen on the trigger components. If one of the
        trigger components receives an event that will cause it to update
        in some way, this component will request to be updated too.
        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of
        two naming containers (including itself if the component is a naming container)
        and begin the search from there, etc.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>persist</td>
<td>String[]</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
a list of attributes whose changes are to be persisted by FilteredPersistenceChangeManager via the &quot;Persistent Change Manager&quot; registered in adf-config.xml.  The token 'ALL' can be used in the list here to indicate that all attribute changes that the component implicitly persists should be included.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>remove</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> inherit, no, disabled<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> inherit<br />
<br />sets the remove ability of the showDetailItem. The default value of &quot;inherit&quot; means that the item
          inherits its remove ability from its parent container. A value of &quot;no&quot; means that when in a container
          that supports item removal, this item is not allowed to be removed. A value of &quot;disabled&quot; means that when in a
          container that supports item removal, this item is not allowed to be removed and it should have a disabled
          remove indicator. Currently, only panelTabbed supports item removal of child showDetailItems.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>rendered</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />whether the component is rendered. When set to false, no output will be
		delivered for this component (the component will not in any way be rendered,
		and cannot be made visible on the client). If you want to change a component's
		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the
                parent refreshes and in turn will render this component.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>shortDesc</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>stretchChildren</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> none, first<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> none<br />
<br />The stretching behavior for children.  Acceptable values include:

<ul>

<li>&quot;none&quot;: does not attempt to stretch any children (the default value and the value you need to use if you have more than a single child; also the value you need to use if the child does not support being stretched)</li>

<li>&quot;first&quot;: stretches the first child (not to be used if you have multiple children as such usage will produce unreliable results; also not to be used if the child does not support being stretched)</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>styleClass</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can
                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you
                     can use one of our public style classes, like 'AFInstructionText'.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>text</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the textual label of the showDetailItem.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>textAndAccessKey</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
an attribute that will simultaneously set both the &quot;text&quot;
and &quot;accessKey&quot; attributes from a single value, using
conventional ampersand ('&amp;') notation.

<p></p>
  For example, setting this attribute to &quot;T&amp;amp;ext&quot; will
  set the text to &quot;Text&quot; and the access key to 'e'.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>unsecure</td>
<td>java.util.Set</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>visible</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
