<b>This component is currently in beta release status.  Please do not use it in production applications.</b>
        
<p></p>
        The conveyor belt component is a container that shows its children oriented horizontally or vertically and allows scrolling among them. When changing which child is displayed, the transition can be animated.
        
<p></p>
        <b>Note about stretching layouts and flowing/scrolling layouts:</b>
        
<p></p>
        With today's web browsers, it is not reliable to have vertically-stretched
        content inside of areas that also have scroll bars.
        If you want the outer areas of your page structure to stretch, you need to
        be careful of how you assemble your component tree.
        
<ul>
        
<li>
        First, build up a structure of stretchable components (using panelSplitters
        or panelGridLayouts).
        </li>
        
<li>
        Second, inside of this structure, create islands of non-stretched content.
        </li>
        </ul>
        Rules of thumb:
        
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        
<li>
        Never nest one scrolling container inside of another scrolling
        container since users do not like nested scroll bars.
        </li>
        
<li>
        Never specify percentage heights in any component's inlineStyle attribute.
        </li>
        
<li>
        Never use the &quot;position&quot; style in any component's inlineStyle attribute.
        </li>
        </ol>
        If you believe that you need to break one of these rules, this is an
        indication that your page structure is not following the page structure
        guidelines and you will likely have troubles getting your application to
        render consistently across various web browsers and computing platforms.
        
<ul>
        
<li>
        For specific details about component stretching, please see the
        &quot;geometry management&quot; section in the tag documentation of each component.
        </li>
        
<li>
        See the demo application for real world layout examples that you can use as a
        starting point in your application.  A good starting point is the &quot;Layout
        Basics&quot; page listed under the &quot;Framework Features&quot; tab of the demo
        application.
        </li>
        </ul>

<b>Default Value:</b> false<br />
<br />whether a client-side component will be generated.  A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

<li>Subsequent characters must be letters (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method), digits as defined by the Character.isDigit() method, 
dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers 
be as short as possible. If a component has been given an identifier, it must be unique in the namespace of the closest ancestor to that component 
that is a NamingContainer (if any).</li>

the CSS styles to use for this component. This

that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of

		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the

the short description of the component. The shortDesc is also commonly used to render an

          long tooltips.</td>

a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can

                     can use one of our public style classes, like 'AFInstructionText'.</td>

A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this

                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
