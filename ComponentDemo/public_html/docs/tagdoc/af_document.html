The document component creates each of the standard root elements of an HTML page:  &lt;html&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;head&gt;, but by abstracting away from those components, can be used in non-HTML pages as well. Only one document component per page is allowed.  Documents must not be placed inside of page templates.

<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>To stretch a document, set maximized to true (the default). This will cause the page's outer-most margin and padding to collapse to 0px. If the document is set to be maximized and if there is only a single effective visual root component, that component will stretch automatically to consume the browser's viewable area--if supported by that component. Examples of components that support this are af:form, af:panelStretchLayout, af:panelSplitter, and af:panelGroupLayout with layout=scroll.</li>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

<tr class="b">

<td>largeIconSource</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
Specifies a large icon that the browser may use when bookmarking this page to your device's home screen.
       If this attribute is not specified, the browser may default to using a file named &quot;apple-touch-icon.png&quot; located at the root of your server.
       (This default behavior is not something provided by this framework and may vary between browsers.)
       This attribute supports a space-delimited list of files (each file may be wrapped in quotes or apostrophes if the file path contains a space).
       If the file path specifies a single leading slash, this means that the file is located inside of the web application's root folder (so &quot;/large-icon.png&quot; would resolve to something like &quot;http://www.oracle.com/adf-faces/large-icon.png&quot;).
       If the file path specifies 2 leading slashes, this means that the file is located inside of the server's root folder (so &quot;//large-icon.png&quot; would resolve to something like &quot;http://www.oracle.com/large-icon.png&quot;).
       Browsers typically expect these files to be at least 57 pixels by 57 pixels but could be as big as 144 pixels by 144 pixels.
       Typically, the first listed file will be the one used.  Otherwise, if a browser only supports certain kinds of files, the first file in the list that uses a supported file extension will be the one that is used for that browser.<br />

If the document is set to be maximized and if there is only a single effective visual root component, that component will stretch automatically to consume the browser's viewable area--if supported by that component.  Examples of components that support this are panelStretchLayout and panelSplitter.

        This component will listen on the trigger components. If one of the

        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component),

        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,

<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

       (This default behavior is not something provided by this framework and may vary between browsers.)
       This attribute supports a space-delimited list of files (each file may be wrapped in quotes or apostrophes if the file path contains a space).
       If the file path specifies a single leading slash, this means that the file is located inside of the web application's root folder (so &quot;/small-icon.png&quot; would resolve to something like &quot;http://www.oracle.com/adf-faces/small-icon.png&quot;).

       Browsers typically expect these files to be 16 pixels by 16 pixels.
