            PanelSplitters are used to divide a region into two parts with a repositionable divider.
            The two parts are identified as the &quot;first&quot; facet and the &quot;second&quot;
            facet. If the contained component supports it, the contents of a section will stretch to
            fill up all available space in that section. The panel splitter can be adjusted with the
            mouse, by pressing a collapse button, or by use of the arrow keys when the splitter is
            selected. A panel splitter can split horizontally or vertically based on the orientation
            attribute.  With focus on the page, pressing Ctrl+Alt+P will move to the next splitter
            collapse/restore button. Subsequently pressing Ctrl+Alt+P will then cycle focus among
            the splitter buttons on the page.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Errors on components in collapsed panes<a name="Errors_on_components_in_collapsed_panes"></a></h2>
            
<p></p>
              If a splitter's collapsed pane contains a component that has an error, e.g. a required input with no value, no error will be reported to the user.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Printable Pages<a name="Printable_Pages"></a></h2>
            
<p></p>
              If you use an &lt;af:showPrintablePageBehavior&gt; within one of
              the panes of the splitter, only that pane will be present for
              printing when the user activates that behavior.  If the behavior
              is outside of the splitter, the printed result will be
              roughly in line with the normal layout, which may mean that
              not all content will be visible.  It's therefore encouraged
              to support printing from within any pane of a splitter
              where printing is important.

<div class="section">
<h3>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h3>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children, e.g. panelStretchLayout if the dimensionsFrom attribute of this panelSplitter is set to &quot;parent&quot;.</li>

<li>This component uses &lt;f:facet name=&quot;first&quot;&gt; and &lt;f:facet name=&quot;second&quot;&gt; to organize content into each splitter panel.  Examples of child components that can be stretched inside of these facets include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:decorativeBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelAccordion&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelCollection&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelHeader&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelSplitter&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelStretchLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelTabbed&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:region&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:table&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:tree&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:treeTable&gt;</li>
</ul>
If you try to put a component inside of this component and that child component does not support being stretched, then the component hierarchy is illegal.
To make it legal, you need to insert another intermediate component between this component and the child component.
This intermediate component must support being stretched and must not stretch its children.
An example of such a component that is commonly used for this purpose is &lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;.
By using a wrapper like this, you create a flowing layout area where nothing will be stretched inside of it.
Examples of components that do not support being stretched inside of these panelStretchLayout facets (and therefore need to be wrapped) include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:panelBorderLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelFormLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;default&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelLabelAndMessage&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelList&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;trh:tableLayout&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
There are other ways in which you can control the geometry of this component when it is not being stretched by its ancestor:

<ul>

<li>You can specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;children&quot; for the panelSplitter to be as tall as the children.  When using this &quot;children&quot; setting, if orientation=&quot;vertical&quot; then the contents of the collapsible panel will not contribute to the size of the panelSplitter since that facet's contents must be constrained to the size specified in splitterPosition.  Also, any height assignment (e.g. inlineStyle or styleClass) on the panelSplitter must be omitted or else there would be a competing assignment for how tall the component will be.</li>

<li>You can also specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot; to make the panelSplitter get its dimensions from the inlineStyle and if not provided from there then from its parent component or if not provided from the parent then from the skin.</li>

<li>Using dimensionsFrom=&quot;auto&quot; will choose either &quot;children&quot; or &quot;parent&quot; depending on whether the panelSplitter is being stretched by its parent.</li>
</ul>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary.

            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

<td>splitterPosition</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> 200<br />
<br />the initial position of the repositionable divider. The panelSplitter separates two areas with a separator.
        The user may drag this separator to adjust how much space is allocated for each area.  This attribute specifies the number of
        pixels for the width or height (depending on the orientation) for one of the areas and the other area gets the remaining space.
        The positionedFromEnd attribute determines which area is sized and which area gets the remaining space.</td>

<td>styleClass</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can
                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you
                     can use one of our public style classes, like 'AFInstructionText'.</td>

<tr class="b">

<td>unsecure</td>
<td>java.util.Set</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>visible</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
