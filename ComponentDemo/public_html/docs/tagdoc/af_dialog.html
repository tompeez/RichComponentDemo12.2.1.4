  The dialog control is a layout element that displays its children inside a dialog
  window and delivers DialogEvents when the OK, Yes, No and Cancel actions are activated.
  The af:dialog must be placed inside a af:popup component and has to be the immediate child of the af:popup and
  only a single child occurrence is supported. To show a dialog use the af:showPopupBehavior tag or programmatically 
  from Javascript, call <tt>show()</tt> on the popup client component. A dialog will automatically hide itself 
  when OK, Yes or No buttons are selected provided that there are not any faces messages of severity of error or 
  greater on the page.  Selecting the Cancel button or close icon will cancel the popup and raise a popup canceled event.

<div class="section">
<h2>Dialog Events<a name="Dialog_Events"></a></h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>Client Dialog Event<a name="Client_Dialog_Event"></a></h3>

<p></p>
  When using the dialog <tt>type</tt> button configurations, action outcomes of type &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; and &quot;cancel&quot; can be intercepted 
  on the client with a &quot;dialog&quot; type listener. Only &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; events will be propagated to the server.  The ESC key, &quot;cancel&quot; button and
  close icon queues a client dialog event with a &quot;cancel&quot; outcome.  Dialog events with a &quot;cancel&quot; outcome will not be sent to the server.   
  Propagation of dialog events to the server can be blocked, as with any RCF event, by calling <tt>cancel()</tt> on the JS event object.  
  Use the af:clientListener with a type of <tt>dialog</tt> to listen for a dialog client event.
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3>Server Dialog Event<a name="Server_Dialog_Event"></a></h3>

<p></p>A dialog will hide after processing the dialog event for error free actions. If an error occurs during the 
  server-side processing (specifically, if faces messages of error severity or greater) of the dialog event, 
  then the dialog will not be closed.    

</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Using Input Components Inside a Dialog<a name="Using_Input_Components_Inside_a_Dialog"></a></h2>

<p></p>
  When using input components, such as <tt>inputText</tt>, pressing the Cancel-button will not
  reset the values on those controls. If you open a dialog for the second time, the old values will
  still be there. If you want the values to match with the current values on the server, this can be
  accomplished by setting <tt>contentDelivery</tt> to <tt>lazyUncached</tt> on the
  containing <tt>popup</tt> component.  The <tt>lazyUncached</tt> content delivery type will 
  cause the content of the popup to be re-rendered but does not reset the server-side state of the component.
  You can force the af:popup to reset any input components in its content when canceled using the <tt>resetEditableValues</tt>
  property set to &quot;whenCanceled&quot;. 

<p></p>
  The dialogs cancel button, Esc key and close icon dismisses the inline popup dialog without saving any changes. 
  However, input components having the autoSubmit property turned on, overrides the dialog's cancel behavior.   


<div class="section">
<h2>Using Custom Dialog Buttons<a name="Using_Custom_Dialog_Buttons"></a></h2>

<p></p>The af:dialog component provides a <tt>buttonBar</tt> facet that is the container to add additional
   command components to the dialogs footer.  Custom buttons are added after pre-configured buttons.  Pre-configured buttons 
   are specified using the <tt>type</tt> property. Custom buttons will not queue the associated <tt>dialogListener</tt> 
   but requires custom action listeners.
   
   
<p></p>Using partial submit custom buttons is recommended because by default, a popup will not restore visibility after a full 
   postback.  The immediate parent (af:popup) controls this behavior.  If the parent popup's <tt>autoCancel</tt> property is 
   <tt>enabled</tt>, full submit commands will cause the popup dialog to auto-dismiss.  When the <tt>autoCancel</tt> property is 
   <tt>disabled</tt>, full submit commands will restore visibility on postback.  See the af:popup tag documentation for more 
   information on controlling aspects of auto-dismissal.
   
   A dialog will not automatically dismiss for custom buttons.  Additional logic must be added to dismiss the 
   popup. This task is accomplished by calling on the server-side popup API.
   
   
<p></p>Another common misunderstanding with inline dialogs is that they do not automatically reset 
   submitted values.  If you have created custom dialog buttons and dismiss the dialog with 
   validation errors, the previous submitted errors will be displayed on subsequent showings 
   if the page has not be refreshed. 
   There are a couple ways to solve this problem. 
   
<ul>
     
<li>Set the <tt>resetEditableValues</tt> of the owning <tt>af:popup</tt> to &quot;whenCanceled&quot;.  This will force input component
         within the content of the popup to be reset when the popup is canceled.</li>
     
<li>For greater control, use the <tt>af:resetListener</tt>. You can choose from any event type but action, popupFetch, 
         popupCanceled, and dialog are all popup choices.</li>
   </ul>
   
<p></p>
   Custom cancel dialog buttons will not discard 
   values like the pre-configured cancel button using the dialog's type property.  This is because 
   the pre-configured cancel button doesn't send a dialog event to the server so the input values 
   contained within the dialogs content will not be applied.  A custom cancel button should have 
   the immediate property set to true and use one of the two method previously described for resetting 
   input components.   
   

<div class="section">
<h2>Understanding Cancel/Close Dismissal<a name="Understanding_CancelClose_Dismissal"></a></h2>

<p></p>The dialog's cancel button, Esc key, and close icon all raise a client only dialog event with 
a &quot;cancel&quot; outcome.  A <tt>dialogListener</tt> will not be notified when the dialog is dismissed 
using these two commands.  However, these commands translate into a popup-canceled event 
of the owning inline popup component.  Server-side listeners can be registered with 
the parent <tt>af:popup</tt> component and will be invoked when the dialog is 
dismissed using a closed dialog event outcome.  The parent popup component can also be configured
to automatically reset input components on cancellation.  This feature is managed using the 
<tt>resetEditableValues</tt> property. See <tt>af:popup</tt> for more information on cancel dismissal.


<div class="section">
<h2>Printable Pages<a name="Printable_Pages"></a></h2>
  Inline popups define content in the page that is hidden by default but when shown is layered above the
  primary document.  Inline popups are not print friendly meaning that their content is excluded 
  from printiable pages similar to navigation components.  This also applies to uses of the
  &lt;af:showPrintablePageBehavior&gt; tag within the content of the af:dialog.


<div class="section">
<h2>Layout Considerations<a name="Layout_Considerations"></a></h2>

<p></p>The table below lists the combinations of two dialog properties that have effects on layout.

   the assumed behaviors for these options besides caveats to look out for.

<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component cannot be stretched by a parent layout component and cannot be assigned dimensions via the inlineStyle or styleClass because it displays on its own layer in the page and gets its dimensions from its children's dimensions or from the specified contentWidth and contentHeight dimensions.</li>

<li>This component will stretch its children if the following circumstances are met:

<ul>

<li>It contains a single child</li>

<li>It has stretchChildren=&quot;first&quot; specified</li>

<li>The child has no width, height, margin, border, and padding</li>

<li>The child must be capable of being stretched</li>
</ul>
Examples of components that can be stretched inside of this component include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:decorativeBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelAccordion&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelCollection&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelHeader&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelSplitter&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelStretchLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelTabbed&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:region&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:table&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:tree&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:treeTable&gt;</li>
</ul>
If you try to put a component inside of this component and that child component does not support being stretched, then the component hierarchy is illegal.
To make it legal, you need to insert another intermediate component between this component and the child component.
This intermediate component must support being stretched and must not stretch its children.
An example of such a component that is commonly used for this purpose is &lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;.
By using a wrapper like this, you create a flowing layout area where nothing will be stretched inside of it.
Examples of components that do not support being stretched inside of these panelStretchLayout facets (and therefore need to be wrapped) include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:panelBorderLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelFormLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;default&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelLabelAndMessage&gt;</li>

An attribute that simultaneously sets the textual label of the ok and yes 
          footer buttons as well as the an optional accessKey character used to gain 
          quick access to the button.  The accessKey is identified using conventional 
          ampersand ('&amp;') notation.
          
<p></p>
          For example, setting this attribute to &quot;T&amp;amp;ext&quot; will
          set the textual label to &quot;Text&quot; and the accessKey to 'e'.
          
<p></p>
          If the same accessKey appears in multiple locations in the
          same page of output, the rendering user agent will cycle
          among the elements accessed by the similar keys.
          
<p></p>
          This accessKey is sometimes referred to as the &quot;mnemonic&quot;.
          
<p></p>
          Note that the accessKey is triggered by browser-specific and platform-specific 
          modifier keys. It even has browser-specific meaning. For example, Internet 
          Explorer will set focus when you press Alt+&lt;accessKey&gt;. Firefox sets focus
          on some operating systems when you press Alt+Shift+&lt;accessKey&gt;. 
          Firefox on other operating systems sets focus when you press Control+&lt;accessKey&gt;.

<td>
An attribute that simultaneously sets the textual label of the cancel 
          footer button as well as the an optional accessKey character used to gain 
          quick access to the button.  The accessKey is identified using conventional 
          ampersand ('&amp;') notation.
          
<p></p>
          For example, setting this attribute to &quot;T&amp;amp;ext&quot; will
          set the textual label to &quot;Text&quot; and the accessKey to 'e'.
          
<p></p>
          If the same accessKey appears in multiple locations in the
          same page of output, the rendering user agent will cycle
          among the elements accessed by the similar keys.
          
<p></p>
          This accessKey is sometimes referred to as the &quot;mnemonic&quot;.
          
<p></p>
          Note that the accessKey is triggered by browser-specific and platform-specific 
          modifier keys. It even has browser-specific meaning. For example, Internet 
          Explorer will set focus when you press Alt+&lt;accessKey&gt;. Firefox sets focus
          on some operating systems when you press Alt+Shift+&lt;accessKey&gt;.

A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that
