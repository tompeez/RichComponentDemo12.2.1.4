            Toolbox is a multi-row container for toolbars and menuBars. Toolboxes ars are not 
            rendered on printable pages.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Toolbox Layout<a name="Toolbox_Layout"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            The display of toolbars and menuBars inside a toolbox is highly customizable, due to the 
            flex and stretchId values of the child toolbars and menuBars. Because toolbars and 
            menuBars are both overflow components, they do not have a set width size. A toolbox 
            should be placed in a section of the page where it can horizontally stretch to the 
            available size for proper rendering. Putting a toolbox inside a section of the page 
            where it is horizontally constrained to a minimum size (like a panelStretchLayout end 
            facet) will be error-prone, due to the fact that the contents of the toolbox (toolbars 
            and menubars) as overflow components do not have a set width.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Toolbox Rows<a name="Toolbox_Rows"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            By default, each toolbar or menuBar placed inside a toolbox will be displayed on its own 
            row. To have several toolbars or menuBars appear on the same row, you can surround these 
            elements with an <tt>&lt;af:group&gt;</tt> component. Please note that while setting 
            up your toolbars and menuBars, you should not nest toolbars or menuBars inside other 
            toolbars or menuBars. This is incompatible with toolbar and menuBar overflow and not 
            supported. Instead, you should use the a toolbox group to arrange the toolbars and 
            menuBars in a row in the desired order.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Right Justifying Items in a Row<a name="Right_Justifying_Items_in_a_Row"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            By default all toolbars and menuBars in a toolbox row are left (start side) justified. 
            In order to make some or all of the toolbar or menuBar items right (end side) justified, 
            you can use the stretchId attibute that is available on toolbar and menuBar. StretchId 
            is usually set to the id of a spacer on the toolbar or menuBar that you want to stretch 
            to take up any available extra horizontal space. Only one stretchId should be specified 
            per toolbox row.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Assigning Percent Width Values to Items in a Row<a name="Assigning_Percent_Width_Values_to_Items_in_a_Row"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            You can use flex values on the toolbars and menuBars to control what percentage of the 
            available horizontal space each toolbar and menuBar should receive. For example, if your 
            toolbox row has 3 toolbars, each with a flex value of &quot;1&quot;, then they receive their flex 
            value (1) of the total space available (3). This means that each of the three toolbars 
            would be given one third of the available horizontal space. 
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Overflow<a name="Overflow"></a></h2>
          
<p></p>
            When a toolbar or menuBar does not have enough space to display all items, the children 
            are put into overflow and an overflow button is displayed. When toolbox row children 
            have flex values, these flex values are strictly followed, even in regards to overflow. 
            When a toolbox row does not have flex values, then the right most (end side) toolbars or 
            menuBars would be forced into overflow before left side toolbars or menuBars. Spacer and 
            image children on toolbars or menuBars that have client components are not put into 
            overflow.
          
<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>
            
<ul>
              
<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches 
                its children, e.g. panelStretchLayout, panelSplitter.</li>
              
<li>This component accepts toolbars and menuBars as children. Toolbox children 
                are stretched horizontally. When there are multiple children per row that have flex 
                values, the toolbox will calculate width values for each child based on their 
                individual flex value compared to the total row flex value. Each child is then 
                stretched to their calculated width. Also of note, child toolbars (toolbar or 
                menuBar) may utilize their stretchId attributes to indicate desire to stretch a 
                child component when there is more space available for a toolbar than used.</li>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

the IDs of the components that should trigger a partial update.

        in some way, this component will request to be updated too.
        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will
        pop out of the component's naming container (or itself if the component is
        a naming container) and begin the search from there, &quot;:::&quot; will pop out of

<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you

                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that

      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the
