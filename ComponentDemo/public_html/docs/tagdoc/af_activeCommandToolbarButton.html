<b>DEPRECATED: </b>The activeCommandToolbarButton component has been deprecated. Use the button component instead.

<p></p>
The activeCommandToolbarButton supports server side state change push for its &quot;visible&quot; attribute. It creates a button in a toolbar. It is normally used inside of a <tt>&lt;af:toolbar&gt;</tt> component. activeCommandToolbarButtons are not rendered on printable pages. Due to performance overhead compared to <tt>&lt;af:commandToolbarButton&gt;</tt>, you should only use this component if you plan to support changing the visible attribute through active data, otherwise you should use the <tt>&lt;af:commandToolbarButton&gt;</tt> component.

<li>activeCommandToolbarButton is normally used inside a toolbar. In this case it 
                behaves as a toolbar child. CommandToolbarButton can also appear outside of a 
                toolbar, in which case the component cannot be stretched by a parent layout 
                component that stretches its children. e.g. panelStretchLayout, panelSplitter.</li>
              
<li>activeCommandToolbarButton can have children via a popup facet, but these children 
                appear in a popup that has its own fixed size and is not effected by layout.</li>

character used to gain quick access to this item.
              
<p></p>
                If the same access key appears in multiple locations in the same 
                page of output, the rendering user agent will cycle among the 
                elements accessed by the similar keys. Note that user agents 
                are inconsistent about dealing with two links having same access 
                key, and so the cycling behavior is dependent on what the user 
                agent provides.
              
<p></p>
                This attribute is sometimes referred to as the &quot;mnemonic&quot;.
              
<p></p>
                The character specified by this attribute <b>must</b> 
                exist in the <tt>text</tt> attribute of this item instance.
                If it does not, the user will receive no visual indication of
                the existence of the accessKey. The easiest, and most convenient
                way to specify both the text and the mnemonic together is to use
                textAndAccessKey.
                
<p></p>
                Note that the accessKey is triggered by browser-specific and platform-specific 
                modifier keys. It even has browser-specific meaning. For example, Internet 
                Explorer will set focus when you press Alt+&lt;accessKey&gt;. Firefox sets focus
                on some operating systems when you press Alt+Shift+&lt;accessKey&gt;. 
                Firefox on other operating systems sets focus when you press Control+&lt;accessKey&gt;. 
                Refer to your browser's documentation for how it treats access keys.</td>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

<td>javax.el.MethodExpression</td>

a method reference to a return listener.This method
      is used to process dialog returnEvents which are generated as a result of either
      calling org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.context.RequestContext.returnFromDialog
      directly or declaratively through the use of a returnActionListener tag.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>selected</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> false<br />
<br />whether the item is selected, for buttons of type radio or check.
        For radio buttons, there is no server model implemented for handling mutual exclusivity. If
        a user clicks a new button, the old selection will be unselected. If you programmatically
        call setSelected(true) from code, you must call setSelected(false) on the prior
        selection as well.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="b">

<td>shortDesc</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can
                     be defined in your jspx page or in a skinning CSS file, for example, or you
                     can use one of our public style classes, like 'AFInstructionText'.</td>

        conventional ampersand ('&amp;') notation.

<td>unsecure</td>
<td>java.util.Set</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

         targeted to the existing window.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="a">

<td>visible</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
