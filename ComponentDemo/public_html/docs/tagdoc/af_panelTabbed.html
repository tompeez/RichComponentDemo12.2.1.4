<p></p>The panelTabbed control can be used to display a group of contents that belongs to
          a showDetailItem. Tab bar(s) with tabs representing the showDetailItem children are displayed.
          Selecting a tab displays the associated showDetailItem. If none of the showDetailItem children
          are selected, the first showDetailItem that is enabled is selected.
          Typically you would put one or more showDetailItem components inside of the
          panelTabbed but you may also alternatively place a facetRef, group, iterator,
          or switcher inside of the panelTabbed as long as these wrappers provide
          showDetailItem components as a result of their execution.
          
<p></p>
          When in emailable or printable mode, the currently selected tab content renders, along with the 
          tab items themselves, which are non-functional.

<div class="section">
<h2>Geometry Management<a name="Geometry_Management"></a></h2>

<ul>

<li>This component can be stretched by a parent layout component that stretches its children, e.g. panelStretchLayout if the dimensionsFrom attribute is set to &quot;parent&quot;.</li>

<li>This component uses &lt;af:showDetailItem&gt; to organize content into each tab body panel.  The &lt;af:showDetailItem&gt; will allow stretching if:

<ul>

<li>The panelTabbed has dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot;</li>

<li>It contains a single child</li>

<li>It has stretchChildren=&quot;first&quot; specified</li>

<li>The child has no width, height, margin, border, and padding</li>

<li>The child must be capable of being stretched</li>
</ul>
Examples of components that can be stretched inside of a &lt;af:showDetailItem&gt; include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:decorativeBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelAccordion&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelBox&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelCollection&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelHeader&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelSplitter&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelStretchLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelTabbed&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:region&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:table&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:tree&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:treeTable&gt;</li>
</ul>
If you try to put a component inside of this component and that child component does not support being stretched, then the component hierarchy is illegal.
To make it legal, you need to insert another intermediate component between this component and the child component.
This intermediate component must support being stretched and must not stretch its children.
An example of such a component that is commonly used for this purpose is &lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;scroll&quot;&gt;.
By using a wrapper like this, you create a flowing layout area where nothing will be stretched inside of it.
Examples of components that do not support being stretched inside of these panelStretchLayout facets (and therefore need to be wrapped) include:

<ul>

<li>&lt;af:panelBorderLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelFormLayout&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;default&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelGroupLayout layout=&quot;horizontal&quot;&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelLabelAndMessage&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;af:panelList&gt;</li>

<li>&lt;trh:tableLayout&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
There are other ways in which you can control the geometry of this component when it is not being stretched by its ancestor:

<ul>

<li>You can specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;disclosedChild&quot; for the panelTabbed to be as tall as the currently-disclosed af:showDetailItem.  When using this &quot;disclosedChild&quot; setting, the stretchChildren attribute on af:showDetailItem and any height assignment on the panelTabbed must be omitted or else there would be a competing assignment for how tall the component will be.</li>

<li>You can also specify dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot; to make the panelTabbed get its dimensions from the inlineStyle and if not provided from there then from its parent component or if not provided from the parent then from the skin (stretchChildren on af:showDetailItem will be honored).</li>

<li>Using dimensionsFrom=&quot;auto&quot; will choose either &quot;disclosedChild&quot; or &quot;parent&quot; depending on whether the panelTabbed is being stretched by its parent.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h2>Supports Compressed Layout<a name="Supports_Compressed_Layout"></a></h2>

<p></p>For horizontal tabs (position attribute is &quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, or &quot;both&quot;), compressed layout modes
   of overflow or conveyor belt tabs can be used. The horizontal conveyor belt includes a popup for 
   direct selection. Which compressed layout mode is used depends on the assignment of the 
   -tr-layout-type skinning key (see skinning documentation). In order for a compressed layout 
   component to work properly, it must be part of a supported layout on the page.

<p></p>For vertical tabs (position attribute is &quot;start&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, or &quot;left&quot;), compressed layout 
   mode of conveyor is used. In order for a compressed layout component to work 
   properly, it must be part of a supported layout on the page.

<p></p>A compressed layout (overflow or conveyor belt) component requires that it is either:

<ul>

<li>in a container that stretches its children, or</li>

<li>in a container that has a set size.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>Under these circumstances, when the compressed layout component is larger than the parent 
        container, the compressed layout component will display buttons to support its particular 
        compressed layout mode (overflow or conveyor belt).

<p></p>For overflow compressed layout mode, selecting the overflow button(s) will show a popup 
        containing the items that didn't fit on the page.

<p></p>For conveyor belt compressed layout mode, selecting the conveyor belt buttons will roll the 
        shown content. In addition, a vertical conveyor belt has a droplist button that shows a popup 
        containing all of the managed items.

<p></p>Setting up a compressed layout (overflow or conveyor belt) component with the following 
        layouts is not supported. If you use one of these layouts, you may have unexpected and 
        inconsistent results:

<ul>

<li>in a container that does not stretch its children.</li>

<li>in a container that displays multiple children horizontally without explicit sizes
         for each child. For example, a panelGroupLayout with layout='horizontal' would be
         invalid, but panelSplitter is OK because it has an explicitly set splitter position.</li>

<li>setting the compressed layout component with a styleClass or inlineStyle that assigns a
         percentage size value. Note that this includes assigning styleClass='AFStretchWidth' on 
         a compressed layout component.</li>
</ul>

However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

<b>Valid Values:</b> above, both, below, start, end, left, right<br />

<p></p>the position of the tab bar. Please note that there are several differences between 
           horizontal (position attribute is &quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, or &quot;both&quot;) and vertical (position 
           attribute is &quot;start&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, or &quot;left&quot;) tabs.
        
<p></p>Horizontal tabs (position attribute is &quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, or &quot;both&quot;) will display 
           specified child icon, text, or both icon and text. Vertical tabs (position attribute is 
           &quot;start&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, or &quot;left&quot;) only display the icon, with the text serving as the 
           alt text for the displayed icon. Because of this, you should always have an assigned 
           icon to children of vertical tabs.
        
<p></p>When using right or left for the position, the tab will remain right or left regardless 
           of the language. For example it will remain right or left even in right to left 
           languages like Hebrew and Arabic. Use start/end if the alignment should change depending 
           on the language.
        
<p></p>The size of the icons displayed in the tab bar will scale automatically based on the 
           position selected. The icon's size is determined via the CSS of the chosen skin. For 
           example, the Alta skin scales icons to 24x24 when the tabs are in the Start position and 
           to 16x16 when the tabs are at the Above position. Icons which are a multiple of the 
           smaller size (e.g., 16x16) will work best (e.g., 32x32).
        
<p></p>Compressed layout handling is supported for horizontal tabs using either overflow or 
           conveyor belt. Compressed layout handling is supported for vertical tabs using conveyor

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />whether the component is rendered. When set to false, no output will be
		delivered for this component (the component will not in any way be rendered,
		and cannot be made visible on the client). If you want to change a component's
		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the
                parent refreshes and in turn will render this component.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>shortDesc</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>

the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

a CSS style class to use for this component. The style class can

<tr class="a">

<td>tabRemoval</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Valid Values:</b> none, all, allExceptLast<br />

<b>Default Value:</b> none<br />
<br />determines if tab removal is enabled. The tabRemoval attribute only applies to horizontal 
        tabs (position attribute is &quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, or &quot;both&quot;).
        
<p></p>This attribute supports these tabRemoval types:
        
<ul>
        
<li> none - tab removal is not enabled.</li>
        
<li> all - tab removal is enabled on all tabs, regardless if they are disclosed. The
          last tab in the panelTabbed can be removed.</li>
        
<li> allExceptLast - tab removal is enabled on all tabs, regardless if they are
          disclosed. The last tab in the panelTabbed cannot be removed.</li>
        </ul>
        
<p></p>Choosing to remove a tab will cause an ItemEvent of type 'remove' to be launched. This
        event can be listened for on a showDetailItem using the itemListener attribute. It is up to
        the developer to handle this event and code the actual removal of the tab. This is because
        of the dynamic nature of the panelTabbed component, which may have dynamic children. This
        also allows a finer level of control by the developer, who can then choose a custom
        implementation that may (for example) include warning dialogs, and control of which tab
        gains focus after a tab is removed.
        
<p></p>Tab removal is only supported for horizontal (position attribute is &quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, or 
           &quot;both&quot;) tabs. Tab removal is not supported for vertical (position attribute is &quot;start&quot;, 
           &quot;end&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, or &quot;left&quot;) tabs.</td>

<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>boolean</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
