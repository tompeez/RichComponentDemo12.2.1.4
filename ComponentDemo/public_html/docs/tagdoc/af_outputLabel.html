          Component that displays a label for a form component,

          Developers should use this if they need
          more control over layout than the built-in label support for
          input components allows.

<p></p>Using outputLabel is one of the ways to label a component. For all input components (and 
compound components that have an input component part to which a label can be assigned), the 
component requires a label. This can be accomplished in one of the following ways (all ways may not 
be available for all components):

<ul>

<li> a 'label' value on the component</li>

<li> a 'labelAndAccessKey' value on the component</li>

<li> wrapping the component with an af:panelLabelAndMessage component that has a 'label' (or 
'labelAndAccessKey') value and a 'for' value specifying the component's id</li>

<li> having a corresponding af:outputLabel component that has a 'value' (or 'valueAndAccessKey') 
value and a 'for' value specifying the component's id</li>

<td>
a character used to gain quick access to the form element specified by the for attribute, if set.
                    If the same access key appears in multiple locations in the
              same page of output, the rendering user agent will cycle
              among the elements accessed by the similar keys.
              
<p></p>
                This attribute is sometimes referred to as the &quot;mnemonic&quot;.
                
<p></p>
                Note that the accessKey is triggered by browser-specific and platform-specific 
                modifier keys. It even has browser-specific meaning. For example, Internet 
                Explorer will set focus when you press Alt+&lt;accessKey&gt;. Firefox sets focus
                on some operating systems when you press Alt+Shift+&lt;accessKey&gt;. 
                Firefox on other operating systems sets focus when you press Control+&lt;accessKey&gt;. 
                Refer to your browser's documentation for how it treats access keys.</td>

<b>Default Value:</b> false<br />
<br />whether a client-side component will be generated.  A component may be generated whether or not this flag is set, but if client Javascript requires the component object, this must be set to true to guarantee the component's presence.  Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM. This ID attribute can alternatively be generated by setting oracle.adf.view.rich.SUPPRESS_IDS to &quot;auto&quot; in web.xml.</td>

<li>Subsequent characters must be letters (as defined by the Character.isLetter() method), digits as defined by the Character.isDigit() method, 
dashes ( - ), or underscores ( _ ).  To minimize the size of responses generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component identifiers 
be as short as possible. If a component has been given an identifier, it must be unique in the namespace of the closest ancestor to that component 
that is a NamingContainer (if any).</li>

the CSS styles to use for this component. This
is intended for basic style changes. The inlineStyle is a set of CSS styles
that are applied to the root DOM element of the component. Be aware that
because of browser CSS precedence rules, CSS rendered on a DOM element takes
precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins
will not be able to override what you set on this attribute. If the
inlineStyle's CSS properties do not affect the DOM element you want affected,
then you will have to create a skin and use the skinning keys which are meant
to target particular DOM elements, like ::label or ::icon-style.</td>

the IDs of the components that should trigger a partial update.
        This component will listen on the trigger components. If one of the

        in some way, this component will request to be updated too.
        Identifiers are relative to the source component (this component), 
        and must account for NamingContainers.  If your component is already inside of a naming
        container, you can use a single colon to start the search from the root of the page,
        or multiple colons to move up through the NamingContainers - &quot;::&quot; will

		rendered attribute from false to true
                using PPR, set the partialTrigger attribute of its parent component so the
                parent refreshes and in turn will render this component.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>shortDesc</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

<td>unsecure</td>
<td>java.util.Set</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>
A whitespace separated list of attributes whose values ordinarily can be set 
                     only on the server, but need to be settable on the client.  Currently, this 
                     is supported only for the &quot;disabled&quot; attribute. Note that when you are able to 
                     set a property on the client, you will be allowed to by using the the 
                     .setProperty('attribute', newValue) method, but not the .setXXXAttribute(newValue) 
                     method. For example, if you have unsecure=&quot;disabled&quot;, then on the client you
                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

<tr class="a">

<td>value</td>
<td>Object</td>

the value of the component.  If the EL binding
for the &quot;value&quot; points to a bean property with a getter but no setter, and
this is an editable component, the component will be rendered

an attribute that will simultaneously set both the &quot;value&quot;

              conventional ampersand ('&amp;') notation.
              
<p></p>
              For example, setting this attribute to &quot;L&amp;amp;abel&quot; will
              set the label to &quot;Label&quot; and the access key to 'a'.</td>

      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
