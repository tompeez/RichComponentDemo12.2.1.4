allows the default HTML header level assignment (H1 through H6) of the header to be overridden. 

<p></p>
Header components are assigned HTML header level assignments of H1 through H6. (Similar to size) 
the header level assigned is determined based on containment within other header components. For 
example, a header that is not contained by another header component will automatically render as an
H1 header level. A child header contained inside this header would automatically render as an H2
header level. While the display of header components is determined by the size skinning selector 
assigned, HTML header level is important for correct page structure, especially when used with 
screen reader applications.

<p></p>
The headerLevel attribute by default is -1, where the HTML header level is then calculated by 
containment as defined above. This is the preferred setting - it is recommended that you design your 
page nesting header components to take advantage of the automatically assigned header levels. 
Alternately, setting the headerLevel attribute to values 1 through 6 will force the corresponding
HTML header level to render as part of the header component, regardless of its containment with 
other header components on the page. 

<p></p>
Plesae be careful if overriding the header level! The HTML header level assignments (H1 through H6) 
controlled by this attribute are relied upon by screen reader applications to appropriately identify 
the underlying structure of the page. Make sure your use of header components and assignment of 
header levels make sense for your page. When using an override value, consider the effects of
having headers inside disclosable sections of the page.</td>

precedence over external stylesheets like the skin file. Therefore skins

the short description of the component. The shortDesc text may be used in two different 
          ways, depending on the component. 
          
<p></p>
            For components with images, the shortDesc is often used to render an HTML alt attribute 
            for the image. Please see the accessibility guidelines section for correct alt text 
            usage of the shortDesc attribute. 
          
<p></p>
            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and 
            provides more accessible descriptive text than the use of the title attribute.</td>

allows the default skinning size of the header to be overridden. 

<p></p>
Sizes for skinning start at size 0 (the largest) and progress to size 5 (the smallest). The size
is determined based on containment within other header components, and is accomplished via the 
assignment of skinning keys. For example, a header that is not contained by another header 
component will automatically be displayed as size 0. A child header contained inside this header
would automatically be displayed as size 1. 

<p></p>
The size attribute by default is -1, where the size is then calculated by containment as defined 
above. This is the preferred setting - it is recommended that you design your page nesting header 
components to take advantage of the automatically assigned sizes. Alternately, setting the size 
attribute to values 0 through 5 will force that size skinning value assignment on the header 
component, regardless of its containment with other header components on the page. 

<p></p>
Please note that while header components support a total of six levels of skinning differentiation,
less than this may be defined in your skin. Also, setting the header size to something greater then 
the supported value will style the header the same as the largest supported value. Please see the 
Skinning Selectors documentation for the assigned skinning keys used by the component.</td>
