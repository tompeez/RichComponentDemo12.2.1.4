<p></p>
        The navigationPane component creates a series of navigation items representing one level in 
        a navigation hierarchy. These items may either be explicitly added as children using the 
        commandNavigationItem component or a model of type 
        <tt>org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.MenuModel</tt> may be bound to 
        the navigationPane component. If a MenuModel is bound, a level along the focus path, or the 
        next level down, will be rendered. A node that is on the focus path will be rendered as 
        &quot;selected&quot;.
        
<p></p>
        <b>Note</b>: The 'level' attribute is temporary. It is used to 
        indicate the level along the focusPath to render. It will likely be 
        replaced with an el expression in a future release.
        
<p></p>
          The MenuModel implementation that are supported out-of-the-box, namely 
          <tt>org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.ProcessMenuModel</tt> and 
          <tt>org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.model.XmlMenuModel</tt>, know how to go from
          the current viewId to the focusRowKey. Notice that the MenuModel has no special knowledge 
          of page navigation and places no requirements on the nodes that go into the tree. The 
          nodes in the tree are stamped out using the 'nodeStamp' facet, which should contain a 
          commandNavigationItem component. This allows the default actionListener mechanism to be 
          used for page navigation.
        
<p></p>
            <b>Note</b>: When using Facelets for the page declaration language (PDL), the
            'nodestamp' facet should still contain only one commandNavigationItem. Multiple components
            are not supported by this facet.
        
<p></p>
          NavigationPane with hint='buttons' and hint='bar' look very similar.  They have different separators.  Additionally, here are the differences:
           
<ul>
            
<li>navigationPane with hint='buttons'</li>          
           </ul>

<li>Used as global navigation items</li>
            
<li>Generally used in global navigation area of the page</li>
            
<li>When there is not have enough horizontal space to display all items, they wrap 
                     to the next line</li>
           </ul>
          
           
<ul>
            
<li>navigationPane with hint='bar'</li>     
           </ul>
           
           
<ul>
            
<li>Used as 4th level navigation tabs</li>
            
<li>When there is not have enough horizontal space to display all items, the 
                     overflow compressed layout manager is used and overflow button(s) are 
                     displayed.</li>
          </ul>

          The navigationPane component does not render on a printable page 
          (&lt;af:showPrintablePageBehavior&gt;).

<div class="section">
<h2>Supports Compressed Layout<a name="Supports_Compressed_Layout"></a></h2>

<p></p>NavigationPane with hint='tabs' or hint='bar' support compressed layout. For hint='bar', 
        when the content is compressed the overflow compressed layout manager is used. For 
        hint='tabs', when the content is compressed either overflow or conveyor belt compressed
        layout manager will be used. For this case, the compressed layout manager used depends on
        the assignment of the -tr-layout-type skinning key (see skinning documentation). In order 
        for a compressed layout component to work properly, it must be part of a supported layout 
        on the page.

<p></p>A compressed layout (overflow or conveyor belt) component requires that it is either:

<ul>

<li>in a container that stretches its children, or</li>

<li>in a container that has a set width.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>Under these circumstances, when the compressed layout component is larger than the parent 
        container, the compressed layout component will display buttons to support its particular 
        compressed layout mode (overflow or conveyor belt).

<p></p>For overflow compressed layout mode, selecting the overflow button(s) will show a popup 
        containing the items that didn't fit on the page.

<p></p>For conveyor belt compressed layout mode, selecting the conveyor belt buttons will roll the 
        shown content. In addition, there is a conveyor belt droplist button that shows a popup 
        containing all of the managed items.

<p></p>Setting up a compressed layout (overflow or conveyor belt) component with the following 
        layouts is not supported. If you use one of these layouts, you may have unexpected and 
        inconsistent results:

<ul>

<li>in a container that does not stretch its children.</li>

<li>in a container that displays multiple children horizontally without explicit sizes 
         for each child. For example, a panelGroupLayout with layout='horizontal' would be 
         invalid, but panelSplitter is OK because it has an explicitly set splitter position.</li>

<li>setting the compressed layout component with a styleClass or inlineStyle that assigns a
         percentage width value. Note that this includes assigning styleClass='AFStretchWidth' on 
         a compressed layout component.</li>
</ul>

Client component objects that are generated today by default may not be present in the future;  setting this flag is the only way to guarantee a component's presence, and clients cannot rely on implicit behavior.  However, there is a performance cost to setting this flag, so clients should avoid turning on client components unless absolutely necessary. For the components outputText and outputFormatted, setting the clientComponent to true will render id attribute for the html DOM.

            shortDesc is also commonly used to render an HTML title attribute, which is used by user 
            agents to display tooltip help text. In this case the behavior for the tooltip is 
            controlled by the user agent, e.g. Firefox 2 truncates long tooltips. For form 
            components, the shortDesc is displayed in a note window. For components that support the 
            helpTopicId attribute and are not using the shortDesc as image alt text, it is 
            recommended that helpTopicId is used instead of shortDesc as it is more flexible and

                     can use the method .setProperty('disabled', false), while the method
                     .setDisabled(false) will not work and will provide a javascript error that 
                     setDisabled is not a function.</td>

<html>
 Name of the EL variable used to reference the varStatus information.
          Once this component has completed rendering, this variable is
          removed (or reverted back to its previous value).
          The VarStatus provides contextual information about the state of the
          component to EL expressions. For components that iterate, varStatus
          also provides loop counter information.  Please see the this
          component's documentation for the specific properties on the varStatus.
          The common properties on varStatus include:
<ul>
<li>&quot;model&quot; - returns the CollectionModel for this component</li>
<li>&quot;index&quot; - returns the zero based row index</li></ul></html></td>

<b>Default Value:</b> true<br />
<br />the visibility of the component.  If it is &quot;false&quot;, the component will 
      be hidden on the client.  Unlike &quot;rendered&quot;, this does not affect the lifecycle on the server 
      - the component may have its bindings executed, etc. - and the visibility of the component can 
      be toggled on and off on the client, or toggled with PPR.  When &quot;rendered&quot; is false, the 
      component will not in any way be rendered, and cannot be made visible on the client. 
      In most cases, use the &quot;rendered&quot; property instead of the &quot;visible&quot; property.<br />
