<li>
          <b>Going forward alta skin will be the default skin supported and Skyros skin is deprecated.</b>
          We recommend applications on skyros skin versions to migrate to alta skin versions which is a fully redesigned, better looking and functioning UI design with a simpler mobile first layout approach. Applications built using Alta UI is more conducive to responsive design techniques and comes with minimal chrome, fewer nested borders and lines. Less chrome means faster loading of the page.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>Deploying your application to a reserved port number</b>
          Ensure that you avoid reserved port numbers when deploying your application. Some application servers will fail to prevent you from deploying your application on a reserved server port (e.g. 1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 37, 42, 43, 53, 77, 79, 87, 95, 101, 102, 103, 104, 109, 110, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 123, 135, 139, 143, 179, 389, 465, 512, 513, 514, 515, 526, 530, 531, 532, 540, 556, 563, 587, 601, 636, 993, 995, 2049, 3659, 4045, 6000, 6665, 6666, 6667, 6668, 6669). If you use one of these reserved ports, some web browsers may honor it but at least WebKit-based browsers (e.g. Safari and Google Chrome) will not. You may see some page content but all resources (images and styles) will fail to load.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>JSF 2 component EL usage will interfere with declarative components</b>
          - By default, JDev has been adding the componentVar=&quot;component&quot; attribute as a default to page templates and declarative components. In JSF 2, &quot;component&quot; is a reserved EL variable used to reference the current component. As a result, any existing declarative components or page templates that utilize the componentVar and have the value set to &quot;component&quot; will not function when run in JSF 2. Declarative component authors will need to refactor their templates and declarative components to use a different name for the componentVar.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>Change to backing bean scope</b>
          The backing bean scope has been changed from being tied to the client ID to the component itself.  The use of client IDs was resulting in the un-intended behavior of having multiple beacking beans being used when include components (declarative component, page template) were placed inside of an iterator. Since this behavior was not intended, the scope is now tied to a component instance. This means that now, if an include component is placed in an &lt;af:iterator/&gt;, only one backing bean scope is created.
          
<p>Due to this having the possibility of regression in applications, a <b>temporary</b>, internal switch, is being supported until applications can switch over to the new behavior. This switch should only be used by applications that have an issue with the new code. This will be the case if an application is developed in such a way that data is stored into the backing bean scope per stamp of an iterating component. Normally this will not be the case. To temporarily revert to the old behavior the &quot;oracle.adfinternal.view.rich.BACKING_BEAN_SCOPE_KEY&quot; system property may be set to &quot;clientId&quot;</p>
          
<p>Example java argument passed to WLS: <tt>-Doracle.adfinternal.view.rich.BACKING_BEAN_SCOPE_KEY=clientId</tt></p>
          
<p>This flag will be removed in future versions, so if you are relying on it, you will need to update your application to adopt the new behavior.</p>
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>Change to af:setPropertyListener/af:setActionListener and command's actionListener execution order in Facelets</b>
          In JSP, the af:setPropertyListener and af:setActionListener tags are called before the command's actionListener. In Facelets, the opposite happened. In 12.1.2.0 we changed the Facelets code so that it works now the same as JSP always has. We don't expect this change to affect many, since Facelets support is fairly new in ADF Faces, and this use case where the Facelet's ordering was desired probably didn't exist for app developers.

<div>
<pre>&lt;af:button actionListener=&quot;{#someListener}&quot;&gt;&lt;af:setPropertyListener ...&gt;&lt;/af:button&gt;</pre></div> For more information, see Bug 12908218 - for facelet pg, value set in setpropertylistener not available in backing bean
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>Skinning now has versioning</b>
          
<p>
          The Skin Framework now supports versioning. If you create skins, then you can add skin versions to your skins, so you can keep the
          skin-family name the same between versions. You create skins in trinidad-skins.xml, and you can add a version to your skin.
          </p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;skin&gt;&lt;id&gt;purple-v2.desktop&lt;/id&gt;&lt;family&gt;purple&lt;/family&gt;&lt;version&gt;&lt;name&gt;v2&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/version&gt;...&lt;/skin&gt;</pre></div>
          You can also set 
<div>
<pre>&lt;default&gt;</pre></div> (child of version) to true if you want that version to be the default skin, the skin that is picked when
          no skin-version is specified in trinidad-config.xml.
          
<p>
          In trinidad-config.xml, you can specify the skin-family and skin-version,
          like </p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;skin-family&gt;purple&lt;/skin-family&gt;&lt;skin-version&gt;v2&lt;/skin-version&gt;</pre></div>
          The skin with matching skin-family and skin-version will be picked, or the best match if an identical match cannot be found.
          
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>fusion-11.1.2.0 and fusion-11.1.1.4.0 skins have been renamed</b>
          If you used the unreleased skins &quot;fusion-11.1.2.0.desktop&quot; or &quot;fusion-11.1.1.4.0.desktop&quot;, these have been renamed.
          The skin-id &quot;fusion-11.1.2.0.desktop&quot; is &quot;fusionFx-v2.desktop&quot; and &quot;fusion-11.1.1.4.0.desktop&quot; is &quot;fusionFx-v1.desktop&quot;. You would have set these skin-ids in trinidad-skins.xml.
          The skin-family &quot;fusion-11.1.2.0&quot; is now &quot;fusionFx&quot; with &quot;v2&quot; as the skin-version. The skin-family &quot;fusion-11.1.1.4.0&quot; is now &quot;fusionFx&quot; (no version).
          You would have set the skin-family in trinidad-config.xml.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>Version 2 of the fusionFx Skin</b>
          There is now a new version of the fusionFx skin available: skin-family: &quot;fusionFx&quot; and skin-version: &quot;v2&quot;. The skin id is &quot;fusionFx-v2.desktop&quot;.
          It has an improved design over the original &quot;fusionFx&quot; look and feel (for example you will see an improved font display for Linux machines
          where many of the common font families are not available by default, the top portion of panelBox components will now blend
          identically with the center portion regardless of whether the header is enabled).
          If you would like to use &quot;fusionFx&quot; version &quot;v2&quot;, you may select it in your trinidad-config.xml file by specifying
          
<div>
<pre>&lt;skin-family&gt;fusionFx&lt;/skin-family&gt;&lt;skin-version&gt;v2&lt;/skin-version&gt;</pre></div>
          Note: In trinidad-config.xml, if you set skin-family to fusionFx, and do not set the skin-version, you will get by default the fusionFx-v1.desktop skin.
          You can learn more about our skinning framework on this

        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>Custom Skin Developers and the fusionFx-v2 Skin</b>
          If you extended either the &quot;fusion.desktop&quot;, &quot;fusion-11.1.1.3.0.desktop&quot;, or &quot;fusionFx-v1.desktop&quot; skins you may now want to instead extend the
          &quot;fusionFx-v2.desktop&quot; skin to inherit from its improved design.  To do so, open up trinidad-skins.xml and change your custom
          skin from using 
<div>
<pre>&lt;extends&gt;fusion.desktop&lt;/extends&gt;</pre></div> or
          
<div>
<pre>&lt;extends&gt;fusionFx-v1.desktop&lt;/extends&gt;</pre></div>to 
<div>
<pre>&lt;extends&gt;fusionFx-v2.desktop&lt;/extends&gt;</pre></div>
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>Projector Skins</b>
          If you would like to view your application on a projector, you can use the provided projector skins. You can download the adf-projector-skin-11.jar
          and include it on your classpath. Once you do that, the new projector skins are available for you to use. To use them, you will
          set the trinidad-config.xml's skin-family element to point to the projector skin. The projector skins we have for you to choose from are:
          fusion-projector, fusion-11.1.1.3.0-projector, fusionFx-projector, and fusionFx-projector version v2.
        </li>

          <b>Supported Browsers</b>
          See the full list of supported browsers <a href="release.html#SupportedPlatforms">here</a>.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>testId and customizationId</b>
          customizationID and testID attributes are deprecated from the
          ADF Faces components. The component id will now always be set with a value by
          the DT removing the need for these two additional attributes. The majority of
          the changes will be transparent to the ADF Faces Rich Client consumers, but
          there is a requirement to run the DT page migrator and there are some action
          items that may affect some but not all consumers. While the page migration task
          is required, it can be done when the application is ready. In addition, MDS
          is smart enough to look for the customizationID if the componentID is null,
          thus preserving backward compatibility for existing customizations. For full
          details of the changes and steps required by consumers, please refer to this
          wiki (http://aseng-wiki.us.oracle.com/asengwiki/display/ASDevADFFaces/Instructions+For+Consumers+-+Proposal+5).

<li>
          <b>skin-selectors documentation</b>
          - Please see the
          <a href="skin-selectors.html">ADF Faces Skinning Selectors
          document</a> that describes the public skinning
          selectors.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>New Window Detection Support</b>
          This feature allows ADF to manage model states correctly when end users open a new window using Ctrl+N from their application, press the refresh button on their browser toolbar (i.e. F5), copy and paste a URL for an ADF Faces app from one window to another, or use the ADF Dialog Framework to open a new browser window.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>MIME multipart/related Email type</b>
          If you use the email mode to render your page in emailable html (e.g., css is inline instead of an external stylesheet because email clients do not load external stylesheets),
          you probably know that all URLs in the page are absolute URLs. If you want to view the email offline, then you need to convert the HTML into MIME-format, and inline the images.
          Now we do that for you if you add this request parameter: org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.agent.email=true<b>&amp;oracle.adf.view.rich.render.emailContentType=multipart/related</b>
        </li>
        
<li><b>Detecting Unstable Component Structures</b><br />
          Many of the layout container components in ADF Faces must loop over their
          children components two or more times in order to produce the desired layout
          structures. In JSF, it is illegal to change the component tree on the fly
          during the render phase of the lifecycle. Such illegal changes could be
          performed by adding components, removing components, changing variables
          behind EL expressions assigned to the components (e.g. the &quot;rendered&quot;
          attribute), or using non-thread-safe EL (e.g. a variable shared among
          multiple users). If the component tree changes between the various passes
          that a container makes over its children, you may encounter various
          undesirable results.<br />
          Common symptoms of such illegal changes include:
          
<ul>
            
<li>IndexOutOfBoundsException messages in the log files</li>
            
<li>Invalid HTML generated for the browser</li>
            
<li>Mismatching content displayed in the browser (e.g. top tabs of a
                panelTabbed not matching bottom tabs)</li>
          </ul>
          In this release, there is a debugging tool to help gather more information
          about these errors in multi-pass container components (e.g. panelGridLayout,
          panelGroupLayout, menuBar, toolbar, etc.). When enabled via the following
          web.xml setting, any time a user reproduces the issue, a detailed report
          will be logged. This report will identify the container component's client
          ID and the list of rendered child component client IDs that it encountered
          during each pass. This detailed log report can then be given to the
          application developer for evaluation. It will tell the application
          developer which children components are unstable; it will help identify
          what kind of fix is needed to correct the issue.<br />

          <b>Automation mode and JSF ProjectStage</b>
          To overcome potential security issues, ADF application can't be used in Production environment with automation enabled. The application will fail to load with an exception when this configuration is set. So make sure to not have automation enabled by default since the default value of JSF ProjectStage is Production. Another change is that automation mode will be enabled by default for SystemTest ProjectStage. With this, we reduce the necessity of defining the automation parameter almost completely.

           <b>Testing harness for application testing</b>
            
<p>
            Introduced a new testing harness that can be used in conjunction with an automated testing engine in order to simplify automated application tests. A testing engine can be setup to use this testing harness. The testing harness will complete necessary setup before a simulated action occurs. The testing harness will complete the following actions in preparation of a mouse action. 1) If a menuBar or toolbar item is currently in overflow, it will first open the overflow before the simulated action on the item occurs. 2) If a simulated action is received on a menu item, the testing harness will first open the menu (and submenus) needed for that menu item to be displayed before the simulated action on the menu item occurs.
            </p>
            
<p>
            Note that menus may have lazy content, in which case their content is not present on the page at all until that menu is explicitly opened. Before benefitting from the test harness opening menus as needed, the menu lazy content will need to be retrieved. To allow this, we have added API methods to the menu component. For a menu that has lazy content, the show() method will retrieve that content, and must be called before any simulated actions on child menu items. The isContentLoaded() API method will inform if menu content is loaded or not, to help determine when show() is needed.

            Developers can use the DateCustomizer to specify additional text that will appear in the header of Calendar date cells. For example, developers can specify &quot;New Year's Day&quot; for Jan 1
            and it will appear under the current date in the Day view. For a list of keys to override in the DateCustomizer, see the tag doc.

<p>
            Calendar component now has a splitter separating the all-day and timed activities region. Users can expand/collapse the splitter to show/hide all-day activities or drag the splitter to resize the two regions.
            App developers can control the splitter using the new attributes: splitterCollapsed and splitterPosition.
            Please refer af:calendar tag documentation for detailed information on the two attributes.
            </p>
          </li>
          
<li>
            <b>Calendar supports color coded date cells</b>
            
<p>
            Developers can specify certain date cells within the Calendar to be color coded by providing an inline style using the DateCustomizer. For example, developers can return a specific background color for dates which are holidays.
            </p>
            
<p>For accessibility, developers should also expose the information provided by color coding in an alternate area of the date cell. To that end, the Calendar component now
            also supports a facet, dateHeaderStamp, which can be used to specify components that will be displayed in the date cell header.
            For example, if the date is color coded because it is a holiday, developers can specify an af:image with the shortDesc set to the holiday name, as well as programmatically specify which date it should display for, and the image will be displayed in the header for that date.
            </p>
            
<p>
            For more information, see the javadoc for DateCustomizer and the Calendar tagdoc description of the facet.

            A new calendar activity identified by CalendarActivity.TimeTtpe.DURATION has been introduced. This allows developers to model tasks, i.e. activities with a fixed time cost but no predetermined start and/or end time.
            </p>
            
<p>
            Just like time and all-day activities, duration activities can span multiple days. By default the calendar will render TimeType.DURATION activities in the all-day region alongside all-day activities. The display of duration activities can be controlled using the newly introduced showActivityTypes attribute. As an additional benefit, the attribute showActivityTypes also selectively turns on or off all-day and timed activity regions in day and week views.
            </p>

            <b>NumberConverter supports attribute to set rounding behavior </b>
            
<p>
            The numberConverter has a new attribute, roundingMode, which controls how the converter rounds numbers. The attribute is EL-bindable and can be set to a java.math.RoundingMode value or
            to a String corresponding to the enum value.
            </p>
            
<p>
            Additionally, the trinidad-config.xml configuration file supports a parameter &lt;rounding-mode&gt; which is also EL-bindable or accepts string values corresponding to the enum. This
            controls the default rounding behavior of numberConverter instances within the application, when they do not have their roundingMode attribute set.
            </p>

<p>
              For automation testing, the suggestions for the current value of the input widget can be retrieved
              by invoking getSuggestedItems API on the instance of AdfAutoSuggestBehavior JS object.

              The getSuggestedItems method returns an array of AdfSelectItem. Selection can be simulated by
              setting the selectItem's value on the client component.

              e.g. var selectItems = inputComp.getBehaviors(AdfAutoSuggestBehavior).getSuggestedItems(inputComp);

              will only function for non-stamped components and only defers the creation of

            <b>Attribute viewportBottom added to panelStretchLayout</b>
            
<p>
              In some cases, you might have a component (like an af:table) in a flowing
              (e.g. scrollable) container and below the table is an area of empty space
              before the end of the browser's viewport. If you want the table to stretch
              to fill up that empty vertical space, the best plan forward is to change
              that component structure to be stretchable. However, as a temporary
              solution, you can now wrap that table with a panelStretchLayout and use its
              new viewportBottom attribute. The table would need to be stretchable (no
              autoHeightRows setup), the panelStretchLayout must be set to explicitly use
              dimensionsFrom=&quot;parent&quot;, and optionally styleClass=&quot;AFStretchWidth&quot;. With
              this setup, the height of the panelStretchLayout will resize such that if
              all the scrolling was at their origins, then the distance from the bottom of
              that panelStretchLayout to the bottom of the viewport will match the number
              of pixels (CSS px units) in the viewportBottom attribute; your table will
              then resize to consume that empty space. The reason why it is not
              recommended to use this attribute for a long-term solution is because the
              user will see the table show up at an initial size and once measurements can
              be taken, will be resized. If the page structure was designed to be
              stretchable in the first place, the user would not see this adjustment take
              place.

            <b>Attribute childCreation added</b> -
            
<p>
              The childCreation attribute has been added to af:showDetail, af:showDetailHeader,
              af:panelBox and af:panelAccordion. This attribute will allow the deferring of the
              creation of children components until the component may be disclosed. The setting
              will only function for non-stamped components and only defers the creation of
              subclasses of UIXComponent. The implementation for these components allows the
              non-component tags to be executed (like listener tags) regardless of the disclosure
              state as well as allowing the facets to be created that are rendered when the
              parent component is undisclosed.

<p>The panelDrawer control can be used to display a group of showDetailItems. Drawer &quot;handles&quot;, aka tabs, represent the showDetailItem children. Selecting a tab/handle opens the drawer and displays the associated showDetailItem. Whether a drawer is open is controlled by the disclosed attribute on the showDetailItem children. If none of the children are disclosed, the drawer is &quot;closed&quot; and it's normally shown as attached to the side of a container.

<p>The panelSpringboard control can be used to display a group of contents that belongs to a showDetailItem. An icon strip with icons representing the showDetailItem children along with the item's contents are displayed when in strip mode, and an grid of icons with no contents shown is displayed in grid mode. When the user selects an icon while the panelSpringboard is in strip mode, the panelSpringboard discloses the associated showDetailItem. When the user selects an icon while the panelSpringboard is in grid mode, this automatically causes the panelSpringboard to display in strip mode.

              <b>Added client side API to determine if Automation is enabled</b> -
              
<p>A new method on AdfPage, isAutomationEnabled(), can be called to determine if automation is currently
                 enabled for this application server.  This is a javascript client side API and would be used like:
                 </p>
  <tt>
<div>

<li>
              <b>Added client side API to determine if css selectors are uncompressed</b> -
              
<p>A new method on AdfPage, areCssSelectorsUncompressed(), can be called to determine if the application server is
                 rendering uncompressed css selectors in our generated html for our components.  Css selectors are required to be
                 uncompressed for some automation frameworks, such as QTP and OATS. This is a javascript client side API and would
                 be used like:</p>
  <tt>
<div>
<pre>
  if (AdfPage.PAGE.areCssSelectorsUncompressed())
  {

              <b>Poll Events can be disabled in Automation Mode</b>
              
<p> To prevent interacting with stale/invisible/unavailable elements while testing caused due to partial/full page refresh because of af:poll, polling can be disabled at application level based on the value of the following property within adf-faces-config element of adf-config.xml
  <tt></p>
<div>
<pre>
  &lt;automation-testing-config&gt;
    &lt;asynchronous-updates&gt;onDemand&lt;asynchronous-updates&gt;
  &lt;/automation-testing-config&gt;
  </pre></div></tt>
              The default value of 'asynchronous-updates' property is &quot;on&quot;. If set to &quot;onDemand&quot;, polling will be disabled.

              
<p>Poll events can also be disabled by setting Java System property -Dautomation-testing-config.asynchronous-updates=onDemand. This system property will override the value set in adf-config.xml</p>

              
<p>Poll Events can be queued on demand using the WebDriver API 'applyAsynchronousUpdates()'. This API will queue all the poll events that would have been queued had polling not been disabled. If there are multiple events on same af:poll component, then only a single event will be queued.</p>

              
<p>Along with this support, a client side API getAsynchronousUpdatesState() has been introduced on AdfPage to determine the state of asynchronous updates. This API could be used like:
  <tt></p>
<div>
<pre>
  if (AdfPage.PAGE.getAsynchronousUpdatesState() == &quot;onDemand&quot;)
  {
    // logic when &lt;asynchronous-updates&gt; is set to &quot;onDemand&quot;

<li><b>Script Partitioning Support for Tablets</b> -
                
<p>Added the ability to segregate touch and desktop specific JavaScript code.  This feature allows the framework to alter
                behavior based on agent capabilities.  A new &quot;touchScreen&quot; capability was added to the trinidad agent.  The &quot;touchScreen&quot;
                capability has three enumerations: &quot;none&quot;, &quot;single&quot;, &quot;multiple&quot;.  The same capabilities map is now published by the
                client AdfAgent.  The &quot;touchScreen&quot;  capability is also available to the implicit agent object that is resolved by
                evaluating EL that defines the &lt;feature-class&gt; node in the XML file for declaring what source files are
                featured in individual script partitions.</p>
                Consider:
  <tt>
<div>
<pre>
  &lt;feature-class&gt;
    ${(agent.webkit and agent.capabilities['touchScreen'] ne 'none') ?

<li><b>Redistributing Touch Events for Tablets</b> -
                
<p>For tablet devices that support touch screens and do not have a mouse, the browser simulates some mouse events but not
                always.  In order to achieve functional equivalency for these platforms, client components need to be broadcast touch
                events.  A new touch event object <tt>AdfComponentTouchEvent</tt> will be made available to components when agents
                support single or multiple &quot;touchScreen&quot; capabilities.  Component peers can conditionally register for touch event
                handling using the same mechanism.</p>

  <tt>
<div>

<li><b>Simulating Context Menu and Tooltip Activation from Touch Gestures for Tablets</b> -
               Webkit on IOS and Android platforms do not raise contextMenu events.  Under the desktop platform the contextMenu event is
               derived from the right mouse click.  The tooltip is also not supported by these platforms.  For desktop browsers the tooltip
               is shown on mouse over of elements that have a title attribute.  Since these tablet devices do not fire contextMenu events
               or show tooltips, we have added an enhancement to simulate this event from touch gestures.  The default gesture is tap+hold (500ms).                    However, this gesture is also used to active component drag-and-drop.  To resolve this conflict, in the cases where drag-and-drop
               behaviors exist for a component, the context menu and tooltip will be activated on tap+hold+finger-up.  Only single finger
               gestures can be used to active context menus and tooltips.

<li><b>Disabling Loading Splash Screen</b> - ADF Faces
              displays a &quot;loading&quot; splash screen for each user on the first

              feedback while various resources (eg. JavaScript libraries) are
              loaded.  Such feedback might not be desirable in all cases.  As
              of this release, the splash screen can be disabled by setting the

<li><b>Content Delivery Networks</b> -
            ADF Faces provides a minimal uri rewriting solution that can be used to apply prefixes to resource (eg. JavaScript, style sheet, image) uris.  This feature is targeted at public facing applications that wish to improve performance by delegating resource delivery to a content delivery network (CDN).  Resource uri prefixing rules are specified centrally in the adf-config.xml file and can be applied both to application-defined as well as ADF-provided resources.  See the &quot;ADF Faces Configuration&quot; appendix of the Oracle Fusion Middleware Web User Interface Developer's Guide for details.

<li><b>Session Timeout Alert Dialog</b> -
             The session timeout warning feature was added in the sherman release.  This feature gives the opportunity to extend the session.
             A warning confirmation dialog is displayed before the session expiration.  A period of seconds is configured via the
             &quot;oracle.adf.view.rich.sessionHandling.WARNING_BEFORE_TIMEOUT&quot; context-param.  If the session is not extended, a final alert dialog is
              displayed notifying of the timeout.  When this dialog is shown, the content in the page underneath the dialog will no longer be visible.              This is a new security feature.
            </li>
            
<li><b>af:target tag</b> -
              ADF Faces provides a new af:target tag that provides a declarative way to allow a component to specify the
              list of targets it wants executed and/or rendered when an event (supported by that component) is raised by
              the component. This feature provides fine-grained control over which components will get executed and which
              will get rendered. Currently the 'partialTriggers' attribute controls both. Finally the 'partialTriggers'
              attribute will continue to work as it does today.

<li><b>Framebusting Param Changes</b> - The framebusting context param 'oracle.adf.view.rich.security.FRAME_BUSTING' has been deprecated in favor of the trinidad param. Please change your web.xml to use 'org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.security.FRAME_BUSTING' instead. The legal values are 'always', 'never', and 'differentOrigin'. If you were setting the value of 'oracle.adf.view.rich.security.FRAME_BUSTING' to 'differentDomain', then please note that you should set 'org.apache.myfaces.trinidad.security.FRAME_BUSTING' to 'differentOrigin'.

<li><b>Skinning changes</b> - '.AFFormComponentOutlineFatal:alias' is now derived from '.AFFormComponentOutlineError:alias'. This is because, ADF Faces implementation uses the same styles for both aliases. Considering that most custom skins would not change the styles between these two aliases, skinners job is now easy. They just need to override 'AFFormComponentOutlineError:alias', and it gets reflected in 'AFFormComponentOutlineFatal:alias' and all the selectors that use this alias. Only in case they want the fatal and error styles to be different, would the skinners need to override both the aliases.

<li><b>Disabling the Compatibility View Alert Dialog</b> - ADF Faces
              displays an alert if users have Internet Explorer configured to run the
              application in the &quot;compatibility view&quot; mode.  This alert asks the users
              to disable it so that the application will run reliably and in a supported
              manner.  Such feedback might not be desirable in all cases.  As of this
              release, the alert can be disabled by setting the
              <tt>oracle.adf.view.rich.HIDE_UNSUPPORTED_BROWSER_ALERTS</tt> context
              parameter to <tt>IECompatibilityModes</tt>.  Even if these alerts are
              hidden, a warning-level log message will still be reported to the client
              logger (such a message will be logged if the
              <tt>oracle.adf.view.rich.LOGGER_LEVEL</tt> context parameter is set

<li><b>Overriding compatibility mode in IE</b> - ADF Faces is not supported in IE browsers running
                in compatibility view mode.  We have enhanced the agent detection logic to use the trident version in the user
                agent string over the browser version.  The framework forces the target document to the maximum document
                mode supported by the browser using the X-UA-Compatible META tag.  This applies to desktop browsers in
                compatibility view mode and also applications that use the IE WebBrowser component to host content within
                desktop applications.

<p>Poll Events can be queued on demand using the WebDriver API 'applyAsynchronousUpdates()'. This API will queue all the poll events that would have been queued had polling not been disabled. If there are multiple events on same af:poll component, then only a single event will be queued.</p>

              
<p>Along with this support, a client side API getAsynchronousUpdatesState() has been introduced on AdfPage to determine the state of asynchronous updates. This API could be used like:
  <tt></p>
<div>
<pre>
  if (AdfPage.PAGE.getAsynchronousUpdatesState() == &quot;onDemand&quot;)
  {
    // logic when &lt;asynchronous-updates&gt; is set to &quot;onDemand&quot;

<p>Added the ability to segregate touch and desktop specific JavaScript code.  This feature allows the framework to alter
                behavior based on agent capabilities.  A new &quot;touchScreen&quot; capability was added to the trinidad agent.  The &quot;touchScreen&quot;
                capability has three enumerations: &quot;none&quot;, &quot;single&quot;, &quot;multiple&quot;.  The same capabilities map is now published by the
                client AdfAgent.  The &quot;touchScreen&quot;  capability is also available to the implicit agent object that is resolved by
                evaluating EL that defines the &lt;feature-class&gt; node in the XML file for declaring what source files are
                featured in individual script partitions.</p>

<p>For tablet devices that support touch screens and do not have a mouse, the browser simulates some mouse events but not
                always.  In order to achieve functional equivalency for these platforms, client components need to be broadcast touch
                events.  A new touch event object <tt>AdfComponentTouchEvent</tt> will be made available to components when agents
                support single or multiple &quot;touchScreen&quot; capabilities.  Component peers can conditionally register for touch event
                handling using the same mechanism.</p>

                on the play button will start the animation of the slider, pausing for the number of miliseconds specified at each increment of the
                slider.  When animated, clicking on the button again will stop the animation. When the value reaches the maximum value, animation will
                stop. If the component is the target of a PPR, animation will stop.

        <b>Support for resizing of search and select dialog of inputListOfValues and inputComboboxListOfValues components.</b>
        
<p>
  The resizing of the search and select dialog of lov components is turned on and the application developers can turn off the feature by
  defining the following skinning key in their custom skin. The skinning is set to true by default in Fusion skin.

              <b>Override default dimensions</b> -
              
<p>By default, certain components default to getting their dimensions from the parent. This makes these components harder to work with in flowing containers, where the desire is usually to get the dimensions from the preferred size of the children components. In order to support this, but still maintain backwards compatibility, we have introduced a new web.xml context parameter. This parameter, when set, will allow the default values of certain attributes to assume a value that fits their current container. For the <tt>dimensionsFrom</tt> attribute, this means that the default value will be &quot;auto&quot; instead of &quot;parent&quot;. This has the affect that the component will determine from its parent component what dimensions to use by default. This affects the <tt>dimensionsFrom</tt> attribute on af:decorativeBox, af:panelAccordion, af:panelDashboard, af:panelStretchLayout, af:panelSplitter and af:panelTabbed.</p>
              
<p>For the table family of components, af:table, af:tree and af:treeTable, setting the new context parameter to auto will result in the default value of <tt>autoHeightRows</tt> to be switched from -1 to 0. Also, the these components will renderer the AFStretchWidth style class when <tt>autoHeightRows</tt> is 0 (and the context parameter has been set to auto).</p>
              
<p>In order to set this new parameter, you must add this to the web.xml of your application:</p>
              
<div>
<pre><tt>  &lt;context-param&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;
        This parameter controls the default value for component geometry on the page.
        Supported values are:
          legacy - component attributes use the default values as specified for the attributes
                   in the tag documentation (default value)
          auto   - component attributes use the correct default value given the value of their
                   parent component. For example, with this setting, the panelStretchLayout
                   will use &quot;auto&quot; as the default value for its &quot;dimensionsFrom&quot; attribute
                   instead of &quot;parent&quot;.
      &lt;/description&gt;

<p>
                Conveyor belt is a new option for managing tabs in a compressed layout. This option is available for af:panelTabbed and af:navigationPane (hint=tabs) components. The default compressed layout mode for these components is overflow. These components have a new skinning property of <tt>-tr-layout-type</tt> that can be set to 'overflow' (the default) or 'conveyor'. When set to conveyor, the component will use the new conveyor belt mode when content is compressed (not enough horizontal space to display all tabs). Conveyor belt consists of buttons to scroll content left or right, as well as a droplist button that shows all available tabs.
              </p>

<p><b>Skin Description</b></p>
                    
<p>A new skin with an updated and modern appearance, called 'Skyros', is now available. Visually the skin is flat, clean, and crisp, and incorporates current UI visual design trends. While look and feel have changed, the size of components in the Skyros skin have not changed, which allows existing applications with Fusion skins to be reimplemented with Skyros skin without requiring layout updates.
                    </p>
                    
<p>The Skyros skin takes advantage of modern skinning techniques (CSS3). For example, it uses CSS rounded corners instead of the image borders used in previous skins. It also uses  CSS gradients for coloring instead of background images. These changes results in a smaller footprint for the skin, with far less images being delivered to the browser than previous skins.
                    </p>
                    
<p>The Skyros skin has been developed for use with the JDeveloper Skin Editor from the ground up, resulting in a skin that is easy to customize. In Skyros, colors have been organized into related anchor and derivative groups, making large color customizations easy to do via the Skin Editor.

<p><b>Getting the Skyros Skin</b></p>
                    
<p>When creating a new application, the Skyros skin is now the default.
                    </p>
                    
<p>For an existing application with it's own custom skin that extends a Fusion skin, you will need to edit your trinidad-skins.xml file. In trinidad-skins.xml, you will change your custom skin to extend Skyros instead, by changing the extends line to a value of 'skyros-v1.desktop'.
                    </p>
                    
<p>For an existing application that uses (but doesn't extend) a Fusion skin, you will need to edit your trinidad-config.xml file. In trinidad-config.xml, your currently selected skin is identified by 'skin-family' and 'skin-version'. Set the skin-family to be 'skyros' and the skin-version to be 'v1'.
                    </p>

<p><b>Things to be Aware of When Updating to Skyros Skin</b></p>
                    
<p>If you have a custom skin and are looking to have your custom skin now extend Skyros, you will need to review your custom skinning keys to see if they apply to the Skyros skin. The same applies for any custom JavaScript or custom components.

<p>A common mistake is having incorrectly specified height and width values set via the inlineStyle attribute. If you have problems like this in your application, they may result in layout problems in the Skyros (or other) skins.
                    </p>
                    
<p>If you are using the decorativeBox component with a navigationPane hint=tabs in the top facet, the topHeight attribute should be set via EL to the navigationPane's -tr-tab-bar-height skinning value ('af|navigationPane-tabs-tr-tab-bar-height'). In order to do this, you will need to have a registered JavaBean that retrieves the tab bar height. Here is an example:
                    </p>
                    
<p></p>
<div>
<pre>
  public class MyBean
  {
    public String getNavigationTabBarHeight()
    {
      if (_cachedTabBarHeight == null)
      {
        Skin skin = RenderingContext.getCurrentInstance().getSkin();
        Object height = skin.getProperty(&quot;af|navigationPane-tabs-tr-tab-bar-height&quot;);
        _cachedTabBarHeight = height.toString();
      }
      return _cachedTabBarHeight;
    }
    private String _cachedTabBarHeight;
  }
                    </pre></div>
                    
<p>With this bean in place, you can set your decorativeBox topHeight attribute using: topHeight=&quot;#{myBean.navigationTabBarHeight}&quot;. By defining your topHeight this way, your top facet will be the correct size, regardless of which skin you use.
                    </p>
                    
<p>Note that if you are moving an existing app over from the Fusion skin to the Skyros skin, you may have problems with navigationPane hint=tabs in a decorativeBox top facet. If the decorativeBox topHeight is hard coded (not using EL like above) then your tabs will appear about 4px above the decorativeBox content. You will need to follow the instructions above so that your tabs are compatible with the Skyros skin.

<p>
                The visibility of tab remove icons has been changed in the version 3 fusion skin. When remove functionality exists for a disclosed tab, the tab remove icon is always visible, where it used to only be visible on mouse over. When remove functionality exists for an undisclosed tab, the tab remove icon is visible upon hover anywhere over the tab, where it used to only be visible on mouse over directly over the icon itself. Also, now when a tab gets focus via the tab key, the tab remove icon is displayed. As before, you can remove a tab via the keyboard by pressing Ctrl Alt F4.
              </p>
              
<p>
                In addition, we have introduced the following new aliases to belp simplify skinning of tab remove icons: .AFTabRemoveImageDisclosed:alias, .AFTabRemoveImageUndisclosed:alias, .AFTabRemoveImageActive:alias, .AFTabDisabledRemoveImage:alias, .AFTabRemoveImageDisabledDisclosed:alias, and .AFTabRemoveImageDisabledUndisclosed.

                visual cues to the user when hovering over text and non-text areas to indicate the affordances - for e.g.,
                hovering over readonly text displays the text cursor. In addition drag and drop inside a table row(s)is only
                available when the drag originates in an area that does not contain text or other editable components.

<p>
                    The Table component supports filtering of data through filter fields on the top of the column headers.
                    To support filtering, &quot;filterModel&quot; attribute needs to be bound to
                    and instance of FilterableQueryDescriptor class. In addition any column that wants to support filtering must have filterable=&quot;true&quot;
                    set along with the sortyProperty=&quot;...&quot;. The &quot;sortProperty&quot; attribute is the key for the filter field in the model.
                  </p>
                  
<p>
                    For the filtering to be model driven, ConjunctionCriterion object returned form
                    FilterableQueryDescriptor#getFilterConjunctionCriterion method must not be null.
                    The components created for filter fields is based on model component type meta-data.
                    However the column &quot;filter&quot; can be used to override the default functionality defined at the model layer.

<li><b>Accessibility: Column Headers for Total/Subtotal Cells (6931494)</b><br /> ADF Faces users can typically produce accessible table content by specifying column headers for every column in their af:table.  However, in certain complex cases, such as when the af:table contains total or subtotal rows, the cell containing the labels for these rows may be inappropriately associated with the containing column's column header.  For example, assuming a column contains employee names and has the header text &quot;Employee Name&quot;, a cell containing the text &quot;Total&quot; will be inappropriately identified to screen reader users as being an &quot;Employee Name&quot;.  In order to avoid confusion, such cells should not be associated with any column header.  ADF Faces does not provide any mechanism for suppressing column headers for such cells.
        </li>
        
<li><b>Accessibility: Keyboard Selection Request Frequency (6238722)</b><br /> When interacting with an af:table, af:tree, or af:treeTable, using the up/down arrow keys to change the selection can result in a round trip to the server.  ADF Faces already optimizes to reduce the number of round-trips by only sending a single request at a time, and also by dropping requests for intermediate selection states that occur while a request is outstanding.  However, in some cases keyboard users may find the current behavior inefficient, since a request is sent to the server as soon as the request queue frees up.  Ideally, no request would be sent until after the user has reached the item that they intend to select - ie. until after the user has paused keyboard activity for some short period of time.
        </li>
		
<li><b>Accessibility: ProgressIndicator reading by JAWS in Firefox</b><br /> The af:progressIndicator component will not be read by JAWS in Firefox. It is due to a JAWS bug.
        </li>
        
<li><b>Active Data Service (6926281)</b><br />
          If Active Data Service is enabled in an application, there are certain ADS pages (/adwwls/wls.ads and adw.jspx) should not be cached. If Oracle Web Cache runs for the application, need to add cache rule to exclude pages with name of /adwwls/wls.ads or adw.jspx.
        </li>
        
<li><b>ADF Faces Stamped Components with MDS</b><br />
        ADF Faces components do not support persisting customization changes to MDS if the component is contained inside of (anywhere in the subtree of) af:forEach or
        af:iterator tags. This limitation is because, while such structure results in multiple component copies in the view tree, they have a single representation in the
        jsp documents.
        </li>
        
<li><b>Application View Cache (6495920)</b><br />The Application View Cache won't work for any page where the rendering of the component tree causes the structure of the component tree to change temporarily. Since this is often the case and the application developer has no way of telling when this will occur, USE_APPLICATION_VIEW_CACHE should never be used. It also only helps initial render performance and does not help the session size.

<li><b>Dialog Framework, new browser window, and RTL Locale (12630300)</b>
          - 
<p>Bug 12630300 identified a layout issue with IE version 9 and greater, Microsoft SR 111072584108293.
          This issue is further isolated to the use of the dialog framework launching a new browser window
          and only when the locale is RTL.  This SR is targeted for IE10 but it is unknown yet if it will
          make this release.  As a workaround the <tt>.AFDialog-tr-enable-ie-rtl-toggle</tt> skinning property key
          can be used to enable a workaround.  This workaround is not implicitly activated.  It must be
          enabled in a custom skin. Consider:
          <tt>@agent ie and (version:9) { .AFDialog { -tr-enable-ie-rtl-toggle: true; } }</tt></p>

<li><b>Emailable Page</b><br />
        The table component has some known issues in emailable page mode.
          
<ul>
          
<li>The Total/Subtotal rows of the table are not bold in Outlook (8554509). The application developer would need to define the bold style directly on
           their outputText.</li>
          
<li>The detailStamp, if disclosed, does not render as disclosed in emailable page mode in both Thunderbird and Outlook (8868756).</li>
          
<li>columnStretching is not supported in emailable mode since this happens in javascript and javascript is not supported by
          email agents (8827678). You need to set the width attribute on the af:column components.</li>
          
<li>The column footers will not format correctly in Outlook if the td has its html width attribute set. This could
          happen if you wrap your footer in a panelGroupLayout, so take care to test on Outlook and if your footer isn't aligning
           correctly, then check the rendered html to see if the td has width set on it, and if so, try to change the layout
            so it is not set.</li>
          </ul>

<li><b>GlassFish Logging Error Message - NoClassDefFoundError: weblogic/servlet/http/AbstractAsyncServlet</b><br />

          This error message can be ignored.
        </li>
        
<li><b>Hot Keys</b><br />
          Application developers must be cautious when assigning access keys to menus.  Hot keys may be intercepted by various browsers or even the operating system.  One such hotkey, ALT-D, will send focus to the address bar in both IE and FireFox 2.  For this hotkey, we have removed the references in our demos.  But many more hotkeys may be restricted so it is a good idea to try them out on all of your supported browsers.
        </li>
        
<li><b>Primary Keys from Model (6894412)</b><br />
          In previous releases, ADF Faces components expect applications to use primary keys on the model data objects that are pre-populated for new records and do not change with any record updates. This limitation has been removed from the current release except for the case where the affected row is not in UI range while its key is changed programatically in a backing bean.
        </li>
        
<li><b>Profiler File Logger</b>
          The profiler file logger can be used only in a non-portal environment on FF and IE browsers with at least 1.5._06 JRE on the client box and privilege to write to the user home dir. The resulting file format is subject to change without any notice and not intended to be used with any xml parser tool. In order to use the feature, the user has to accept the certificate.

<li>
          <b>RichText Editor Error Messages (11686814)</b><br />
          It is recommended that the application developer add a validation rule for situations where the Error Message
          returned by the RichText Editor would include the text contained in the RichText Editor and that text may be
          large enough to not be properly displayed by the browser.

<li>
          <b>RichText Editor on Tablet devices</b><br />
          
<ul>
            
<li>If the rows attribute is not specified then the editable area of the RichText Editor in RichText Editing Mode will grow with the content added. Therefore, when running on tablet devices, please make sure the component is configured with the rows attribute defined.</li>
            
<li>Once the user clicks on the editable area the keyboard opens up. Clicking outside the editable area (such as the toolbar buttons) will then close the keyboard. In addition, the cursor position will not be retained upon clicking back on the editable area.</li>
            
<li>On all versions of iOS any touch event listeners added to the document are disabled when the editable area of the RTE has focus and are added back again on blur. This is due to iOS bug http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=2527401. Therefore, if you have manually added any touch event listeners to the document, please make sure you have used the ADF API AdfAgent.addBubbleEventListener() to do so. That way your touch event listeners are removed and restored properly.</li>
            
<li>af:clientListener can be used with RichText Editor to listen to keyboard events. However, on tablet devices the key modifiers in the keyboard events will not be valid due to browser limitations.</li>

<ul>
            
<li>The code editor uses the hidden text area in its implementation and its a webdriver and selenium limitation that developer cannot type or set a value on hidden field.</li>
            
<li>To set the value for the codeEditor content webdriver api can be used &quot;setRichComponentProperty(locator,&quot;value&quot;,&quot;somevalue&quot;);&quot; where locator will be id of codeEditor component</li>

          <b>Skinned Icons Resize (10058868)</b><br />
          Until recently there were limitations with skinning icons that -tr-rule-ref and -tr-inhibit were not supported.
          Further, the skin properties were not inherited from base skin for icon selectors.
          We fixed these limitations to make the icon selector behavior consistent with general skinning style selectors.
          Now that we inherit the skin properties for icons, if there were 'content' and other properties like 'width'
          and 'height' set, and you override just the 'content' property in your custom skin, you would inherit the
          'width' and 'height' from the base skin. While this is a change in behavior, it is a change in right direction.
          If this behavior is not desirable, skinners can use -tr-inhibit to inhibit some properties or 'tr-inhibit: all'
          to inhibit all properties before overriding the 'content' property.
        </li>
        
<li><b>StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in org.apache.myfaces.trinidadinternal.style.util.CSSGenerationUtils (9400134)</b>
          This error happens due to bug http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6875866 (HotSpot compiler bug in String.indexOf()
          using SSE4.2 instruction-set on new Intel chips). Workaround: Add this line to the JVM options: -XX:-UseSSE42Intrinsics then remove the cached CSS file, e.g., $APP_TMP_FOLDER/public/adf/styles/cache/blafplus-desktop-ezog8j-en-ltr-gecko-1.9.1.8-cmp.css. restart WLS, clear your browser cache and everything should be working.
          Please note that the bug should be fixed with jdk6.18b02 but we see it on 6.18b07

<li><b>User Activity Monitoring and Browser Support</b>
          
<ul>
            
<li>Because of a limitation in the IE userData persistence behavior, the userActivity
            data for previous requests may be partially or sometimes completely unavailable when
            accessed from pages with a different URL than was used when the page was originally saved.
            In IE 5 and later, data stored using IE userData persistence is accessible only to web pages
            within the same directory and on the same domain. This means that a webpage in a sub folder
            though part of the same origin cannot access the data persisted by a page in its ancestor
            folder (8809021). Additionally when IE userData persistence is disabled, client-side
            tracking of user activity data will be unavailable (it's recommended that the Oracle
            RUEI feature be explicitly disabled in this case).</li>
            
<li>In Safari when a user goes into Private Browsing mode, user activity monitoring will
            be disabled and as a result no user activity data will be reported. The reason for this
            is because the DOM sessionStorage object is unavailable as for storing any data and
            attempts to set a value on it throws an error (14368121).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
<li>
          <b>User Activity Monitoring and Client-side Redirects (13610257)</b><br />
          PPR requests that result in a client-side redirect now include in its resposne headers 2 new parameters - Adf-Location and Adf-Status-Code.
          Adf-Location points to the redirected URL as determined by the server, but the URL may change as determined by the client PPR Navigation
          logic. So the actual page user is redirected to might not actually be the one in Adf-Location.
        </li>
        
<li><b>User Specified Window Names</b><br /> In this release we start to support user specified window names. A user can launch a window and give it a name, and we will continue to use that name if it's valid. Currently the supported character set for window name is : [a-z][A-Z][0-9]_

<li><b>InputFile component in multiple file upload mode using IE</b>
          When an InputFile component configured to support multiple file upload is used with IE with Java enabled, the following settings must be set.
          
<ul>
            
<li>In the IE security level for the zone, the option &quot;Include local directory path when uploading files to the server&quot; must be enabled.</li>

<li><b>InputFile component in multiple file upload mode using Java 7</b><br />
          When an InputFile component configured to support multiple file upload is used with Java 7, security level for Java Control panel must be set to Medium or lower.

<li><b>Supported browsers for InputFile component in multiple file upload mode</b>
          Multiple file upload is supported on all release supported browser versions. However, there are a few features of InputFile in multiple upload mode which are dependent on Browser version and Java applet support.
